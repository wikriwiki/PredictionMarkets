We can't have this conversation without knowing that it's very complicated situation, right? You believe you would be more pro-Israel than Donald Trump? I believe that Donald Trump is dangerous. What weaknesses do you bring to the table? That's a great question, Joe. Well, I am certainly not perfect, so let's start there. And I think that... I perhaps a weakness, some would say, but I actually think it's the strength, is I really do value having a team of very smart people around me. Within minutes of that catastrophe, CNN had to admit she blew it. The things that would concern me is, when she doesn't want to answer a question, her habit is to kind of go to a word-salut city. She focused a lot more on Donald Trump. I think it's fair to say than she did on many specifics. If her goal was to close the deal, they're not sure she did that. Dana, typical interview, they tell you that when someone asks you, what your greatest weakness is, you turn it into a strength. Was that the moment to do that? Well, of course. And I was thinking today about... She's really never had to have a tough campaign. So when you run statewide as a Democrat in California, I guess the primary is difficult, but you don't really have to differentiate yourself from an opposing viewpoint. And that's the same for the Senate races. And then she was in the Senate. She did... I think she skipped 60% of the votes when she was in the Senate, so she wasn't even there for that debate. And then she gets this, it gets handed to her... Well, because she's on the ticket with Biden, you could maybe say arguably that she helped, but that was Biden, and she's just on the ticket, like Tim Walles is on her ticket. I think last night, they finally put her out there on a high wire without a net, and she fell over and over again on her face. And don't take it from me. That's David Axelrod from CNN. He said it much more politely, but even for me, I've looked for ways to compliment her. But I sit there and I think, how in the world, when you are at the White House, you can call anybody. Anybody will pick up your phone call if you're... The Vice President would like a briefing on this or that. The Vice President would want something else. They are at your back-end call. You could get up to speed. So they spend the entire day the other day, getting ready for interviews and a town hall, but basically she just steps on a rake the entire time. I think it was the most damaging campaign event that she's had to date this morning, Jim Messina, also an Obama guy. He was on America's newsroom. He also said, not great, but he said she has room to grow. And I said, okay, but does she have time to grow? And he said, that's a great question. And I think we all know the answer to that. 13 days, Greg. Does she have time to grow? I think she doesn't have to grow. I like her the way she is. I thought she was amazing. You know, when CNN is slamming you, that's like parents at a literally game, heckling their own kid. They realize they couldn't find a silver lining on this big sack of poo. It's like, it's physically impossible to spin wet garbage because it ends up all over you. I think we need to retire the phrase word salad because at least salad can be nutritious. You know, you can have actually authentic ingredients. In this case, her manner of speaking, it's in a front to lettuce and kale growers everywhere. You know, after every disaster relief pours in, it's kind of like that with Kamala. So like there's this, like hurricane Kamala comes in, there's a rush to raise money for the victim. There's benefit concerts. They're asking for small donations. Because every time she lands, there's devastation, mainly to herself, but also to her party. I think what you're seeing though, the realization here is the downfall of the inauthentic. You know, whatever you say about Trump, good or bad, you know it's real, he's authentic. So authentic, he doesn't need to employ a fake accent wherever he goes or create fake personal stories or professional histories with Harris. Whatever you say about her, good or bad, you know it's inauthentic, right? Nothing rings true, nothing. Her upbringing, her professional experience, her very words that come out of her mouth, like toxic glitter, stick all over you. Every time she's talking, your brain cells want to commit suicide. So I think what you're seeing is an American public coming to the realization that they may not like Trump, but they don't know what the hell this is. What was that last night, Judge Junin? Well, that's what a billion dollars gets you with a candidate that is so horrible, she can't even articulate what she's going to do to make your life better. And you know, the amazing part of this is, she is so out of her league, she's like a high school JV playing in the pros. She could not articulate other than to say she's not Joe Biden. She can't say what she's gonna do better, she doesn't have any answers to solutions. And she has had the audacity to sit in a position of power in the White House, the highest rank that a woman has ever attained in the United States of America. And she hasn't made any difference for the American people who are suffering from inflation, the economy, crime, immigration. And she just sits there like a queen on the pedestal and says, when I get in, if you vote for me, then I'll deal with the issues. That's not how it works in America. She couldn't even connect with the people who are asking her questions. Click here to subscribe to the Fox News YouTube page to catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis.

"Trump takes lead on VP Harris, top pollster reveals 'gut' prediction",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt8UgIdBU4s,2024-10-24 15:30:09+00:00,Will Trump win Florida by 8+ points?,0.6138694286346436," And look, let us in real talk. It's going to be a tight race until the very end. She got to get out there and vote. OK, all right, that's it, right? That's the message, the closing message. We're going to take you to the board right now and show you what came out last night. This is Wall Street Journal now. It's a national poll. Everything you're about to see is within the margin of error, OK? Wall Street Journal has got Trump up two points nationally, 4745, which pretty much matches what we put out last week at the Fox News Channel 5048. Reuters has Harris with a three point advantage here. And USA today has Harris with a one point lead. But again, all this stuff within the margin of error, you can poke around yourself and find a lot of things out there like the swing state. There are a lot of people voting in Georgia, by the way. 30% of the estimated vote has already cast a ballot in Georgia. It's amazing stuff. They got a great website, too, by the way. If you want to check that out and go deep into the weeds, as we say, we think Georgia right now, according to the Maris poll anyway, it's a tie. Arizona Maris poll has got Trump up a point. And North Carolina, they've got Trump up two points. But again, all this stuff is within the margin of error. Every yellow state you see in this map right now is having some form of voting right now, OK? And I want to do something here. If I can go ahead and find it on the calendar, we are toward the end of October. Coming up on Halloween, we are here Thursday, October 24th, and today, early in person begins in the state of Maryland. But on Saturday, let me try and do this here. On Saturday, you got early in-person voting. And we're going to get a measure of what's happening in Florida. And we're going to be able to gauge Trump's strength down there. Michigan, meanwhile, also early in person that day, which you know is a critical battleground state. In addition to New Jersey and New York, don't want to discount them. They're votes matter right now. But Saturday is a big day. I want to speak to being in the weeds. Tom Bevin, real clear politics with me now. Tom, good morning to you. The website you run right now has the national average, Trump 48.7, sorry, Trump 48.5 and Harris 48.7. Go ahead, Tom. Yeah, I mean, this race, you know, Kamala Harris had a two-point lead in our RCP two-way national average just a couple of weeks ago. But as you mentioned, the Wall Street Journal poll came out last night. CNBC came out this morning with Trump up, too. And so that lead has shrunk now to the point where he, if the trend continues, he'll move ahead in our national average sometime in the next 24 hours. If we get another poll that sort of confirms that he's got some forward momentum. OK, I'm going to ask the love you're right about that. Swing State's matter, though, as you well know. We've got seven battleground states. We've been looking at them for months now. Nate Silver, New York Times. Here we go. My gut says Donald Trump. And my guess is that it is true for many anxious Democrats. But a 50-50 forecast really does mean 50-50. And you should be open to the possibility that those forecasts are wrong. And that could be the case equally in the direction of Mr. Trump and his Harris. I don't know how you answer that, Tom. I think it is the question that we get more than any others. You're under Canon in 2016. You're under Canon in 2020. You're trying to compensate for that now. Can the pollsters do it? Can they be right? Well, I tell everybody, this is one of Don Rumsfeld's great. It's the known, unknown, right? We know it's an issue, but we can't possibly know whether the outcome and tell all of the votes are counted. I will say, obviously, the polls did under count Trump in 2016. They were worse at the national level in 2020. But for example, in Pennsylvania, our CP average was 1.2%. That's exactly what the vote came in at. And so, look, most of these races in the Seven Batagrand States are within the margin of error, as you mentioned, and within a single point. It looks like Trump's gotten a little bit of separation in Georgia and a little bit of separation in Arizona. But Harris's most likely path is still through Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin. She would win 272.68. And those races, I mean, I think six of the last nine polls we have in our average in Wisconsin are an absolute tie. Absolute tie. So it is that close. And I think it is going to come down to, as you said, who can get their voters out? Who can find those ballots and harvest those ballots? The Democrats have proven they've got a pretty good ground game, and they are banking on that being the difference in this race. All right. You mentioned Pennsylvania. Come back to the moment, Kelly and Kamui, with us yesterday, on America's Newsroom. Donald Trump, 2024 is repeating what he did in 2016, blanketing and blitzing these swing states, as is Jay DeVance, who's been defensiveing at 19 times in C.B. game, the vice presidential nominee. And Kamui Harris is doing what Hillary Clinton did. She's somewhat ignoring these three blue wall states in favor of Texas. That last answer is a reference to a visit in Houston on Friday. Here we go, Politico. Pennsylvania is such a mess. Inside team Harris is unusual levels of finger pointing. This is a very long article, Tom. It's online now. They've got a lot of sourcing on there. And they mention names, which you don't often find in a lot of pieces. What was your take on that in Pennsylvania? Yeah. Well, when you start to see articles like this, where people are leaking to Politico and other news outlets and sort of showing the level of frustration and anxiety they have, it's obviously never a good sign for the campaign. And Pennsylvania is, I mean, listen, it is 19 electoral votes. It cannot be replaced by any other state. If you lose Pennsylvania, you have to win two other states to get those 19 electoral votes back, which is why both campaigns are fighting so furiously for it. We just had a poll came out today, Bill. The Franklin and Marshall, the final poll in Pennsylvania, it has Donald Trump up one point among likely voters, 50, 49. That is a four point swing in his favor since their last poll last month. And just as a point of reference, the Franklin and Marshall final poll in 2020 had Biden up six points. And as I mentioned, he won by 1.2. So it's a pretty favorable poll for Donald Trump. But again, still some time left in the state. Got it quickly, 538 in Pennsylvania's got Harris trailing by two tenths of a point. Your average real clear has Trump leading by half a point. That's why you watch. Thank you, Tom, for coming on. We'll talk soon. Tom Bevin, real clear. Thank you. Closing in now, final week of the election. A new Wall Street Journal poll came out last night. Both candidates run in neck and neck. Here we go, National Poll. VP Harris at 45, Donald Trump at 47. She was on a CNN town hall last night and grilled on a wide range of issues and served up. What was considered by many to be a lot of vague answers and this is kind of how that went down. Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist? Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Three weeks before the first presidential debate with Joe Biden, you insted executive actions that had a dramatic impact, really shut down people crossing over. Why didn't your administration do that in 2022, 2023? We have cut the flow of immigration by over half. Why not do it in 2022, 2023? Because we were working with Congress. What would you do to bring prices down for Americans? I took on price gouging. And part of my plan is to create a new approach that is the first time that we will have a national ban on price gouging. And we need to have laws in place that make those who would commit crimes on behalf of anti-Semitism and hate that they pay a serious consequence. But I'm going to tell you what doesn't help. Go online to listen to John Kelly, the former chief of staff of Donald Trump, who has told us Donald Trump said, why essentially, why aren't my generals like those of Hitler's? There's a whole lot there in that sound. By Jim Messina from the left, my right, Carl Rove to the left, from the right, my left. That's confusing. I'm dying. Now they're confused. Let's go, guys. You look at the numbers every day. Where's the race now? You go. Point to us. Rather be him than her. But because he's got a lead on the economy, the inflation and the border. But this is tied. And anybody who tells you how this is going to turn out, every morning I get up and take 538, real clear politics and silver bulletin and take the numbers for each one of the seven states. Battleground states. And so we got 21 data points. In two instances out of that 21, the lead for, in this case, Donald Trump is two points or better. Five, the lead for either him or her is between one and two percent. And 14 of them are less than 1 percent. So it's a toss up. Does she have the momentum that she needs to try to close this out? If it is a coin toss, do you think she can edge ahead? I do for two reasons. One, I think she's got room to grow. Fully a fifth of undecided voters, so they don't know enough about her. And so she's got some room to grow there. Second, she's investing hundreds of millions of dollars in a ground operation. And I think Carl's exactly right. This is a coin toss race. And if it's a coin toss race, their bet is they can win it on the ground. OK, the New York Times last night, what's that town hall? They thought there was a lot of vacuous answers. And that's how they scored it. Donald Trump, what he's doing at these rallies is he gets to this point where he gets like a minute and a half where he says, this is what I'm going to do. And everything he says is a headline on a policy that he would support. Here's an example from last night, Duluth, Georgia. Check it out. We're going to close the borders. First day, first hour, first minute. We're going to close our borders. We're going to take the criminals immediately. We will deport the criminals. We're going to get them out fast. We're going to get them out fast. We're going to drill, baby drill. We're going to get our energy prices down. We're going to get our country back in order. And I think we're going to have, Bert. I think we're going to have the four greatest years in the history of our country. Yeah. Yeah. When you were doing campaigns, both you gentlemen, how important was it to make us a sinked closing argument? Very important. And obviously, the emphasis on being optimistic is important. But he keeps stepping on this, talking about, you know, Arnold Palmer's privates and, you know, saying, you know, 39 minutes of dance music. This is a, the most disciplined campaign. His staff has run, but he remains undisciplined. And in the next 12 days, you need to have him saying that kind of thing with a little bit more depth and substance to it, and less on the sort of the riffing that has caused people to, you know, if he says something sort of wild, the media is going to cover the wild thing rather than the substantive thing. And the substantive thing is what's going to sell the voters. Jim, I wanted to ask you this because based on the, the answer that you had before, if you could call for number four, this is a Wall Street Journal poll. Who voters trust more on the top issues? Trump's ahead by 15 points on immigration, 12 points on the economy and nine points on crime. Israel's war, she's up 15. She's up 14 on abortion on those five issues. You said she has room to grow. Yeah. But we're 12 days out. Does she have time to grow? It's a good question. She's in her 92nd day on the campaign. This is more like a European snap election than anything else. And so this is her big challenge. If she loses, it'll be in part because she wasn't the nominee in time to really grow. But she's got a succinct message. I think the best part of that CNN town hall was at the very end when she had her closing and she said, look, he's in it for himself. He's in it to, he has an enemies list and I have it to do lists for the American public. If that's how she can close, then I think she'll be successful. I agree with Carl. That clip you showed was exactly what he needs to do. The problem is the other 91 minutes of that rally were him rambling about Arnold Palmer's genitalia. This is what Carl writes today. They can both lose, but either one could. That is in the world. Anybody to stick your neck out? I didn't. I didn't write the headline, but I think it's pretty darn it. That's what you say all the time. Listen, I know you're scouring the early vote as many of us are. I think Georgia and I've told our viewers this last hour, they have an extraordinary website. And 30% of the expected vote in Georgia has already been banked. And they break it down primarily on race, white and African-American. What appears obvious to me is that in the state and Nevada, Republicans are voting early and in big numbers. What also appears apparent to me is that in Georgia, African-Americans are not voting at a level where you need to win statewide. Conversely, you can make a case that more women are voting and I don't know if that plays to abortion against Trump. But these are all little pieces that we're trying to maybe push and pull every day. We're going to be careful because what's good is to compare it to a baseline. But we can't compare it to 2020. With COVID, it was entirely distorted. But you're right, in Nevada, there are two things going on in Nevada. One is, I sort of grew up, part of my job was spent there. We used to call them the cow counties, but now John Ralston, the pre-eminent, journalists in the state, it's this we call them the Rurals. But they are deep red. They voted for Trump three and four to one. And they came in heavy early. But yesterday, the Democrat vote in Clark County, Las Vegas, began to come in and cut the Republican lead on the early vote. But the fact that Republicans are leading on the early vote is represented with something else. The old saw used to be in Nevada. Republicans had a shot if the registration gap was 100,000. That is to say, there were up to, there were less than 100,000 fewer Republicans. And Democrats, the gap today, 19,000, 19,000. Now, there's been a growth of the, what they call in Nevada, the nonpartisan, those are the independence. They're now the largest group, 34% of the electorate, 30% Democrat, 29% Republican. Who those people are is going to determine the outcome of the election, but the Republicans are on the march in the state. Final work. I agree in Nevada, I think that's true. But if you look at early vote in Michigan and Pennsylvania, higher than expected African American turnout. So, Carl Sroy, Nevada has gone from the easiest state when I ran Obama to win to the toughest of the seven states, for exactly that reason. But early vote looks better in the Midwest for the Democrats. Okay. See you's right. Great to have you both. Thank you. What an honor. Thank you so much. Carl Rove, thank you guys.

'She never knew?': Harris under fire for claiming Biden is fit to lead,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZg9NMY4UnU,2024-10-24 07:30:06+00:00,Will Trump drop out of presidential race?,0.6416972279548645," All right, well, 94 days ago, Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, and since then, Vice President Harris has been accused of being part of a massive cover-up. Hiding the truth from Americans about Biden's mental fitness and his ability to run the country, Harris was directly asked about this. Here's how she responded. Can you say that you were honest with the American people about what you saw in those moments with President Biden as you were with him again and again repeatedly in that time? Of course. Joe Biden is an extremely accomplished, experienced, and capable in every way that anyone would want if they're president. You never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with him? It was a bad debate. People have bad debates. Should he? He is absolutely. But that's the reason why you're here. And he's not running for the top of the ticket. Well you'd have to ask him if that's the only reason why. What do you think? I am running for President of the United States. Joe Biden is not. So the name of this segment is receipts. I'm officially calling it that. Oh, thank you. What did Kamala Harris know about Biden's mental acuity and when did she know it? Well, let's start with the legendary Carl Bernstein. Here is his reporting based on long time friends of Joe Biden and what they observed. Well, these are people. Several of them who are very close to President Biden, who love him, have supported him, have been among them or some people who've raised a lot of money for him. And they are adamant that what we saw the other night, the Joe Biden we saw, is not a one-off. That there have been 15, 20 occasions in the last year and a half when the President has appeared somewhat as he did in that horror show that we witnessed. There have been numerous instances where the President has lost his train of thought. Can't pick it up again. There was a fundraiser at which he started at the podium and then he became very stiff according to the people there as if it were almost a kind of rigor mortis. Oh. That's brutal, Harris. And that's long time friends notice, but Kamala Harris didn't? Well, and that was several days after the June 27th debate and we forget how big of a news cycle this created. So yeah, I don't know how she wouldn't have known. Even if she hadn't watched it, people at the top of like strategy and analysis food chains were talking about it, journalists were talking about it. Yeah, I think that the disingenuous answer to that question that she seems to be giving now either a non-answer and silence or I don't know what you mean. These are not the droids you're looking for. It really makes her out to be somebody who's out of touch. Like Americans want to know the truth and they want to know that you can recognize the truth and that you're willing to tell the truth and try to solve the problems with the truth and toe. This looks problematic and it kind of feeds that drama, Kayleigh. Are they okay behind the scenes, Biden and Kamala? Because you saw, I mean, Al Gore probably wishes now or back then that he hadn't walked away from Bill Clinton or if he was going to, he needed to do it earlier. Same thing with her. Yes, now Charles, we cannot bring a Carl Bernstein receipt without a Bob Woodward receipt. So Woodward and Bernstein, the legendary Watergate reporters and Woodward's upcoming book, here's what Alex Thompson found. Woodward reports in his new book that Biden donors began expressing concerns about Biden's mental fitness in June of 2023. At Alaska Toes event, Biden was frighteningly awful and like your 87 year old senile grandfather, he could not wait to sit down and only took two prearranged questions. He struggled to find the word veteran. The crowd was unsettled. He goes on to say in a separate event, Biden told the same story three times. So since June of 2023, but Kamala never knew. Right. I honestly believe that there were signs of this before the election, before the process and that the Democrats chose to go along with Biden. You know, they felt, hey, you know, they had an opportunity to nip this in the bud. So it's obviously, it's everyone that she knew. What I was really intriguing to me, though, is the Cavalier way she left it. I don't know if you guys remember the movie Goodfellas? Yes, yes. What do you mean? Tommy thought he was going to get mad. That's the car we took. Remember Tommy thought he was going to get mad. He went to the garage and so his boy called their play. And so what's going on? It's a, we got a problem. He didn't make it. We did everything we could and that's that. Next time they ask him about that, this is going to say he didn't make it. And that's that. Let's keep it moving. Wow. Because it's so Cavalier now the way they're treating this guy. It was the president Trump's point of sort of a mini coup. Remember that Monday when Biden came out with the letter saying, all of these people voted for me. I am a nominee. I am not leaving. And I think what he really wanted to say is you guys knew I was in this condition when this whole process began and then one stepped in. You know, Emily has an attorney. You know the importance of eyewitness accounts. I just played for you were secondary accounts from sources, but there was an eyewitness account from Olivia Newsy and New York magazine that came out. And here's what Olivia Newsy said after an event with the president, the reporters were standing outside of the room. So they had just seen Biden and she wrote this exiting the room after the photo, the group of reporters not instigated by me. I should note, made guesses about how dead Biden appeared to be percentage wise, 40 percent one of them asked. These are reporters that saw it. So you have longtime friends and now reporters, but Kamala didn't see anything. Look, to the 40 percent point, I think that's generous number one. Number two, absolutely. Guys, we know that he has been propped up from his inner circles, from the apologetic media, from everything forever for so many years. We know that in fact when he was sworn in, that was, or taken the oath of office, that was frankly past his time. You are right that he was sore. He was wounded. He was absolutely injured by the fact that he was dethroned, but the reality was, he was frankly well-past the intellectual arc that he should have been at to assume the presidency. And what I saw in Kamala Harris' answers to the point about being an attorney, I know Jack Tremarco, however, that was such a sign of stress. The looking to the right, the searching for words, the not being prepared. She was stressed by that question and she was woefully unprepared. And I feel as someone who was part of the dethroning, why do you not have a more solid answer? Of course you are lying. Of course we have seen him decompensating and aging and half dead for months. We've been talking about it here forever. We've been polite. We've been journalistically objective. I've probably been less so. And I think the whole point is it's obvious, right? So now, her saying that, yo, we know you're lying, but I'm tired and wish that a presidential candidate would be a little more smooth in reassuring me because that guy has the nuclear code still. And you are telling me that that guy is the one saying President Trump is the threat and in charge of the nuclear codes? Get out. Emily, but here's what she told us when Robert Hurts sat down for hours upon hours with Biden and said he's a well-meaning, but elderly on mid old man not fit to stand trial, here's what Kamala Harris said. This is the cherry on top of our receipts. So the way that the president's demeanor in that report was characterized could not be more wrong on the facts and clearly politically motivated gratuitous. So Lily, Carl Bernstein wrong, Bob Woodward wrong, Olivia Newsie wrong, Robert Hurts wrong, Kamala. I guess she was talking about that. And it's an opportunity to rise up to what leadership is about and sometimes as leaders you have to own up to the truth and say it openly the way people want to hear it. That's right. I think you honor the legacy because we cannot deny there is a legacy with a sitting president with a long career that President Biden has had. You honor more of that by acknowledging the greatness that he's left before this moment, this season in his life. Aging shouldn't be demonized, but we are. And we're dancing around it as if it's not a thing. We've seen it with our parents. I saw it with my own father before he was passing and it doesn't make him any less or the legacy any less. She could lean into that and acknowledge her strength in fresh leadership without just looking the other way as if it's not there. Yeah. And when you're making decisions in the situation room about withdrawal of Afghanistan, we have a right to question the mental acuity. Hey, everyone.

Jesse Watters: Kamala just does what she's told,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZkuOWvx9Pw,2024-10-24 01:13:43+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win the 2024 US Presidential Election?,0.6483749747276306," The clock is ticking on Kamala Harris, less than two weeks until Election Day. Democrats are getting prickly about her campaign. Politico says she's running on yesterday in Trump rather than tomorrow and her. Kamala still hasn't been able to answer the easiest question. Who are you? She can't tell us because one mistake came over. The election is that close. House. Whole Lee cow from a historical perspective. We are heading into the election with the closest polls in the electoral college that we have ever seen at least over the last 50 years. Real clear says the race is too close to call. It's the tightest race in over half a century. And the only campaign event Kamala has done in the last 48 hours. She stopped it at Delhi. I'm definitely on the stromian rye and a slice of German chocolate cake. Democrats are telling each other if this is a vibe election, the current vibes ain't great. And now people are starting to cry. As I said, people are very emotional today and a lot of tension in democratic land because they're behaving as if they're losing. I'm just telling you that's the view of Democrats too, not just the media, not just the publicans. Trump's in Georgia tonight with country star Jason Aldin, Tulsi Gabbard, RFK Jr. and Tucker. We're expecting some pyrotechnics tonight. We'll take you there later. So stay tuned. Meanwhile, Democrats are still in the getting to know her face. Kamala wants America to know she's friends with Liz Cheney. And the left doesn't like that. The Cheney thing. Do we really have to do that? Uh look, I…E it goes broad and that look, Bernie Sanders. Dick Cheney, Taylor Swift, negative one… Hold the shooting. No, no, no. Having the Cheney's on board? Nah, you can't! Dick Cheney or Taylor Swift? No! Dick! Right, big tape! nag country. armored Taylor Swift. To get us to invade. It doesn't mean me to agree with this. We're not going to take their foreign policy decisions and discussions you know, and implement those. We're going to take their… Trump's promise? Yeah, it's promise. She sat down with Telemundo and she looked too faced. Watch. Right now we're talking about border security, and there's nobody, no Democrat, talking about pathway to citizenship, an immigration belief, and that... I'm talking about... I'm talking about... The benefits that migrants bring to this country. Oh, but there is no question that migrants bring... America is a country that was built in part by immigrants. People are concerned about their TPS, third-back out there. We're talking about my... Mysyportations. I'm not talking about anything. What do you stand on mysyportations? What's your stand there? This... we need smart, humane immigration policy in America. That includes a pathway to citizenship. Mmm. So she went from tough girl touring the border with agents to mass amnesty. Telemundo had to interrupt her almost as much as Brett Baer. Paul suggests that you're having shortcomings with Latinos, specifically with Latino men. Why do you think that President Donald Trump has been able to make those gains with Latinos? Listen, Donald Trump has... When he was president, had policies that I think have been very harmful to working people. You know, he gave tax cuts to billionaires in the biggest corporations. He will do that again. Without... What's your winning with Latino voters? I'm not winning, not winning, but, you know, winning more voters. This is not my experience. My experience is I talk with Latino voters every day all the time. And there is an incredible amount of support there. Reporters are getting testy with Harris. NBC asked her about taxpayer-funded sex changes three times. Still couldn't get an answer. Do you believe that Charenes gender Americans should have access to gender-affirming care in this country? I believe we should follow the law. I mean, I think you're probably pointing to the fact that Donald Trump's campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars. They're trying to define you on this. Yes, I'm asking you to define yourself, though. I believe that people as the law states, even on this issue about federal law, that that is a decision that doctors will make in terms of what is medically necessary. I will move on, but I don't know that I heard a clear answer from you on the issue of gender-affirming care. What do you want the LGBTQ plus community to know as they're looking for a full-throated backing from you for trans-Americans? I believe that all people should be treated with dignity and respect. Period. Comma-Legis does what she's told, but you can't say that. So every answer is as painful for her as it is for you and me. And if she doesn't know where she's going, how is she gonna take us with her? His plans will weaken America's economy. Then why do you think that's not landing with voters? Well, but I think it's the opposite. Former President Trump leads you on this issue. Well, when I'm out, this is why I'm going out to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. And Michigan, excuse me, just got in late this morning, actually. The Comma-Legis calling Trump tired and unfit, but hasn't held a campaign event in two days and can't remember Michigan. Thankfully, the voters know a lot more about Comma-Legis than she does about us. What are your feelings, and let me start with the women here about Comma Harris? I don't think that she has the personality. I don't think that she has what it takes to go up against Putin and go up against these other presidents that are built for this. She don't understand our struggles. And for me to believe you for another four years, you're crazy. Like you're crazy. You're saying the same thing that you said four years ago. Trump talks about this a lot. He says, you know, Comma Harris became black when it was convenient. Do you agree with him on that? Do you feel like she's wearing her blackness? Absolutely. When she swore on to the Senate, it was as the first Indian-American. Thank you. It's fine. We don't care. We all know she's not black. Let's understand it. We are all clear of that. But my point of view, when I told you earlier, she's already been there. She's in office right now. Shouldn't black women and Philly be right or die? That should be your base. At MSNBC was trying to cherry pick, and they still couldn't find any love for Harris. It's gotten so crazy that Barack Obama is now saying Trump's too old. You're going to vote, which means you're going to let a bunch of old people decide your future. You wouldn't do that about your music. You wouldn't do that about your clothes. But you're going to let them decide what your future, your potential careers, what the environment's going to look like. You're going to let them decide that. And you're not going to be, you're just going to opt out. That doesn't make any sense. Barry with the gray hair, telling black men not to listen to boomers, it's kind of funny after he made us listen to Joe Biden for four years. The oldest president of all time. Black men are still sore over the last lecture. I was deeply interested in it, and it felt like a moment where it's like, you inwards better get in line, and do what we say. And it felt like the demo, him as the czar of the Democratic Party coming down to say, go get these inwards in line. And the general tone of it was disgusting. It was abhorrent. I don't respect it. I didn't like nothing about it. And Democrats don't care if you're disrespected. Whatever it takes to win. Carville says, time to play dirty. And I'm really not interested in being very fair about the whole goddamn thing. Okay? I really don't think we should have fought fair against the Germans or the Japanese. I think we should have snuck around them. And I think we should have gone behind him and lines and cut that... ...throats because that was what it was at stake. I think we're literally approaching the same place right now. I'm not talking about everybody stop. Don't think. I'm not talking about actually slitting a political opponent's throat. After Trump survived two assassination attempts, Democrats are calling him Hitler saying it's time to slit throats. So it means it's time for... New hoax alert. New hoax alert. New hoax alert. The left's biggest hoax, Jeff Regulberg at the Atlantic, has cooked up a doozy. Says Trump admired Hitler. There's no recordings of this and everyone says it's baloney. But the VP who swallows hoaxes to go with their word salads, ran to the cameras. It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of six million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Americans. Donald Trump is someone who I quote certainly falls into the general definition of fascists, who in fact vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military as his personal militia. She was quoting Kelly there. Kamala is asking for trouble. She knows the secret service can barely protect 45. She's playing with fire. She knows it. And so is the White House. So just to be clear, when you said we do agree President Biden believes that Donald Trump is like... I mean, yes. What you've said, he said himself. The former president has said he is going to be a dictator on day one. We cannot ignore that. So in 24 hours, the highest levels of the Democrat establishment have called Trump a Nazi who should be locked up and have his throat slit. If Donald Trump wins, how are we going to have a peaceful transition? The left is saying Trump's a dictator who's going to turn the military on them. They're just going to hand him the keys to the White House and pretend like he's Mitt Romney. They're not just smearing Trump. They're saying half the country's Hitler. Listen, it doesn't so much matter that Donald Trump is selling fascism. What really matters is that roughly half of Americans, including a clear majority of American men, are buying it. The average American man is saying yes to fascism right now. Why? In the last week, they've said American men are sexist fascists, oh, whose only chance of getting lucky in bed is if they vote for Kamala. They're admitting they have Trump derangement syndrome. I'm an optimistic person. I'm not hysterical. I laugh when people say, oh, you've got Trump derangement syndrome. If you're a reasonable person, you should have Trump derangement syndrome. Rules for men, Jimmy, listen closely. Men should never let another person make them rationally emotional. You don't give someone else power over you. Deep breath, Jimmy. Stoicism.

People are concerned about their TPS, third-back out there. We're talking about my... Mysyportations. I'm not talking about anything. What do you stand on mysyportations? What's your stand there? This... we need smart, humane immigration policy in America. That includes a pathway to citizenship. Mmm. So she went from tough girl touring the border with agents to mass amnesty. Telemundo had to interrupt her almost as much as Brett Baer. Paul suggests that you're having shortcomings with Latinos, specifically with Latino men. Why do you think that President Donald Trump has been able to make those gains with Latinos? Listen, Donald Trump has... When he was president, had policies that I think have been very harmful to working people. You know, he gave tax cuts to billionaires in the biggest corporations. He will do that again. Without... What's your winning with Latino voters? I'm not winning, not winning, but, you know, winning more voters. This is not my experience. My experience is I talk with Latino voters every day all the time. And there is an incredible amount of support there. Reporters are getting testy with Harris. NBC asked her about taxpayer-funded sex changes three times. Still couldn't get an answer. Do you believe that Charenes gender Americans should have access to gender-affirming care in this country? I believe we should follow the law. I mean, I think you're probably pointing to the fact that Donald Trump's campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars. They're trying to define you on this. Yes, I'm asking you to define yourself, though. I believe that people as the law states, even on this issue about federal law, that that is a decision that doctors will make in terms of what is medically necessary. I will move on, but I don't know that I heard a clear answer from you on the issue of gender-affirming care. What do you want the LGBTQ plus community to know as they're looking for a full-throated backing from you for trans-Americans? I believe that all people should be treated with dignity and respect. Period. Comma-Legis does what she's told, but you can't say that. So every answer is as painful for her as it is for you and me. And if she doesn't know where she's going, how is she gonna take us with her? His plans will weaken America's economy. Then why do you think that's not landing with voters? Well, but I think it's the opposite. Former President Trump leads you on this issue. Well, when I'm out, this is why I'm going out to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. And Michigan, excuse me, just got in late this morning, actually. The Comma-Legis calling Trump tired and unfit, but hasn't held a campaign event in two days and can't remember Michigan. Thankfully, the voters know a lot more about Comma-Legis than she does about us. What are your feelings, and let me start with the women here about Comma Harris? I don't think that she has the personality. I don't think that she has what it takes to go up against Putin and go up against these other presidents that are built for this. She don't understand our struggles. And for me to believe you for another four years, you're crazy. Like you're crazy. You're saying the same thing that you said four years ago. Trump talks about this a lot. He says, you know, Comma Harris became black when it was convenient. Do you agree with him on that? Do you feel like she's wearing her blackness? Absolutely. When she swore on to the Senate, it was as the first Indian-American. Thank you. It's fine. We don't care. We all know she's not black. Let's understand it. We are all clear of that. But my point of view, when I told you earlier, she's already been there. She's in office right now. Shouldn't black women and Philly be right or die? That should be your base. At MSNBC was trying to cherry pick, and they still couldn't find any love for Harris. It's gotten so crazy that Barack Obama is now saying Trump's too old. You're going to vote, which means you're going to let a bunch of old people decide your future. You wouldn't do that about your music. You wouldn't do that about your clothes. But you're going to let them decide what your future, your potential careers, what the environment's going to look like. You're going to let them decide that. And you're not going to be, you're just going to opt out. That doesn't make any sense. Barry with the gray hair, telling black men not to listen to boomers, it's kind of funny after he made us listen to Joe Biden for four years. The oldest president of all time. Black men are still sore over the last lecture. I was deeply interested in it, and it felt like a moment where it's like, you inwards better get in line, and do what we say. And it felt like the demo, him as the czar of the Democratic Party coming down to say, go get these inwards in line. And the general tone of it was disgusting. It was abhorrent. I don't respect it. I didn't like nothing about it. And Democrats don't care if you're disrespected. Whatever it takes to win. Carville says, time to play dirty. And I'm really not interested in being very fair about the whole goddamn thing. Okay? I really don't think we should have fought fair against the Germans or the Japanese. I think we should have snuck around them. And I think we should have gone behind him and lines and cut that... ...throats because that was what it was at stake. I think we're literally approaching the same place right now. I'm not talking about everybody stop. Don't think. I'm not talking about actually slitting a political opponent's throat. After Trump survived two assassination attempts, Democrats are calling him Hitler saying it's time to slit throats. So it means it's time for... New hoax alert. New hoax alert. New hoax alert. The left's biggest hoax, Jeff Regulberg at the Atlantic, has cooked up a doozy. Says Trump admired Hitler. There's no recordings of this and everyone says it's baloney. But the VP who swallows hoaxes to go with their word salads, ran to the cameras. It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of six million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Americans. Donald Trump is someone who I quote certainly falls into the general definition of fascists, who in fact vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military as his personal militia. She was quoting Kelly there. Kamala is asking for trouble. She knows the secret service can barely protect 45. She's playing with fire. She knows it. And so is the White House. So just to be clear, when you said we do agree President Biden believes that Donald Trump is like... I mean, yes. What you've said, he said himself. The former president has said he is going to be a dictator on day one. We cannot ignore that. So in 24 hours, the highest levels of the Democrat establishment have called Trump a Nazi who should be locked up and have his throat slit. If Donald Trump wins, how are we going to have a peaceful transition? The left is saying Trump's a dictator who's going to turn the military on them. They're just going to hand him the keys to the White House and pretend like he's Mitt Romney. They're not just smearing Trump. They're saying half the country's Hitler. Listen, it doesn't so much matter that Donald Trump is selling fascism. What really matters is that roughly half of Americans, including a clear majority of American men, are buying it. The average American man is saying yes to fascism right now. Why? In the last week, they've said American men are sexist fascists, oh, whose only chance of getting lucky in bed is if they vote for Kamala. They're admitting they have Trump derangement syndrome. I'm an optimistic person. I'm not hysterical. I laugh when people say, oh, you've got Trump derangement syndrome. If you're a reasonable person, you should have Trump derangement syndrome. Rules for men, Jimmy, listen closely. Men should never let another person make them rationally emotional. You don't give someone else power over you. Deep breath, Jimmy. Stoicism.

Gutfeld blasts Kamala Harris for shoveling up 'load of crap' on Biden's mental acuity,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UEfIWrlp1Y,2024-10-23 22:17:01+00:00,Kamala Harris and JD Vance debate before election?,0.6403186321258545," I'm Greg Gutfeld along with Judge Jeanine Piero, Harold Ford Jr. Jesse Waters and she wants when skinny dipping in a cereal bowl with snap crap apple crackle and pop. Grapple. Peanut Bruno. 13 days to go in the razor tight race that could go either way has the Democrats pop in Xanax like candy. The latest real clear politics average shows Kamala and Trump locked in a dead heat. But headline after headline shows one side is freaking the bleep out. CNN claims that a jittery Harris campaign makes big plans to clinch a narrow win. Politico says the clock is ticking and there's quote ominous signs that Kamala Harris's blue wall is collapsing. Making matters worse for Harris. She's talking to the press. Harris bump bumbling her way through two interviews that she took all day to prepare for. And there's nobody. No Democrat talking about pathway to citizenship and immigration relief and that the benefits that migrants bring to this country. Oh, but there's no question that migrants bring the America is a country that is built in part by immigrants. My plans will strengthen America's economy. Former president Trump leads you on this issue. Well, when I'm out, this is why I'm going out to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and and and and Michigan. And again, excuse me. Just got in late this morning, actually. That's reassuring. Kamala also shoveling up this load of crap about Joe Biden being capable of the presidency. Can you say that you were honest with the American people about what you saw in those moments with President Biden? Of course. You never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with him. It was a bad debate. That's the reason why you're here. And he's not running for the top of the ticket. Well, you'd have to ask him if that's the only reason why. Can the American people trust you in these moments, even when it's maybe uncomfortable for Americans to have to to level with Americans in that way? I speak with not only sincerity, but with a real first hand account of watching. Can you do this work? Wow. That was pretty. That was hard to watch, Harold, unlike you. That response to the question about Biden's decline and her awareness of it. And she says he was capable in every measure. So I'm giving you three options. Is Harris stupid? Is she lying or is she drunk? You only get to pick one. I think she was none of those things. Look, I'm going to be back around the table. Those questions are ones that are uncomfortable for her. But she knows you're coming. She doesn't. She probably should have a clear answer. I think the question about migrants offering benefits to our country. We're all migrants in this country. You could have gone back and talked about that. And so we now got to protect our borders. I'm not. I was born here. Sorry. The. I'm not a immigrant. No, I'm not a immigrant. We're all immigrant. We're all immigrant. We're all immigrant. We're all immigrant. I'm not immigrant. My people got brought here by force. But we'll get another case. Okay, where's the character? My people. You're 0.1%. So I think she's trying to do here at the end. And it's going to be interesting to see what works. And we talked a little bit about it yesterday. Her end and clothes is character. And she's trying. That's what she's trying to present with a lot of the former staffers of President Trump, who are out making claims about what he was like to work with and work for. And people have an opportunity to hear that and see if it's believable. And President Trump is out talking about performance and talking about the economy and border security. And I think voters, you know, for those who are undecided, this is kind of the gut check moment. I think the thing that the clips you showed Greg or fair clips to show that the questions are not being answered as you want. I think it's fair for Democrats to talk about Republicans that are supporting her. And I think it's fair for her to talk about the things that she doesn't like or had disagreement with President Trump about how he served and even shortly after the election. And over the next 13 days, as early voting continues to make records in a lot of these states, we're going to get a chance to see who people believe. Is it character? Is it performance? Is it a combination? Or is it neither of those things? And voters will make that determination. It's the great thing about our country. So I'm going to put that down as drunk. Jesse. So Harold frames this as character versus performance. But how can she run under this label of character when she's being accused of probably the biggest plagiarism of any politician? I mean, this would sink even your career. Come on. But you've seen the latest. I mean, this stuff should be leading every network. Well, they're not going to touch it. And they just want to talk about Trump. I wouldn't close with character. That's not going to win your election. I don't just think she just looks like an obsessive stalker. We've now entered stalker territory with her. All she does is talk about Trump. She's looking backwards. She's focused on Trump instead of looking to tomorrow, talking about Kamala Harris. Because everybody's still wondering about her. She never gives anybody a hint. You look at her economic agenda. It's like when you go to a restaurant, you look at the menu and you're like, what is this place? Nothing looks good. It's all confusing. And then your friends ask you what you had the night before and you're like, don't even remember. You're like, was it, was it Ville? I just know it was expensive. And then she, she's has the same question every time. Did you see anything from Joe Biden that concerned you? Whatever she says, she's going to come off as a liar. If she says she saw something, well, she never told us she saw something. So she's part of the cover up. And if she says she never saw anything, no one believes that because obviously everybody saw that. So she's a liar. She's too faced on Tel Amundo. A month ago, she was at the border saying she's going to get tough. And now she's saying, oh, yes, am the Steve for everybody. Donald Trump is closing with positive vibes. He's doing MSG. He did gut-feld. He's in barber shops. He's at football games. He's doing Rogan. These are the types of things that break through. These are these kinds of sad traditional way. Sixty minutes, the view, Brett Baer. And those interviews are bombing Brett Brexit. Wow, Brett. Those are traditional interviews. And the energy coming out of those have all been negative. And her surrogates are sticking their foot in their mouths, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama. All of the Democrats in these battleground states are running away from her towards him, the early enthusiasm. The early vote. Remember Republicans were upset. They're like, I don't know. They've formed out all these ground game operations to outside the campaign. There's huge enthusiasm coming out here. I'm not saying it's over. I mean, I think what was it? 2000 and was it 12? They had super storm Sandy. Romney was tied. All of a sudden, Barack parachutes in with the bomber jacket and the logo, hugs Christie. Romney looks at a touch and he loses the election. So anything could happen, but Trump has momentum. I like the menu at a restaurant. Like her economic agenda as a menu, one page would be for only blacks. The other page would be for Mexicans. Mexican would have family style, blacks just weed. It's a crypto. You can pay with crypto. Dana, it seems to me that either she's too lazy or too cocky to come up with an answer for something she knows is coming. And you know there is an answer to that question. You're in this business. She says, when did you know Joe Biden was in mental decline and why didn't you say anything about it? You know there's an answer. And she knows that she's, well, there is the truth. Yeah. And then there's the fact that she can't and won't. Part of it is out of loyalty and the other thing is because she can't and won't. They took the entire day off yesterday to prepare for two interviews. And you still end up with headlines like this. And I think at this point, no one is coming to save you. No one is going to win this for you. Trump isn't even going to win this for you. Like you yourself, if you're advising her, you say, man, you have to do this yourself. You have to do something and it's getting late really quickly. She's going to Texas tomorrow. Now I understand my president Trump is going to Texas. He's doing the Joe Rogan interview. That seems to make a lot of sense. She's going to Texas. Why? Well, Friday, excuse me. So it feels like Thursday. In my ear, I have my little angel. There are a bunch of really rich people who think that they can do all this fundraising and get call and all read the congressman to beat Ted Cruz in the Senate race. And they would love nothing more than to beat Ted Cruz. Thing is, she's not, or her campaign's not strong enough to say, no rich people, I'm not going to spend an entire day in Texas to chase down your fantasy of beating Ted Cruz because it's not going to work. She should be in Michigan today. Even Johnny is in Michigan today. Yes. Even Johnny. And he says Michigan looks like Trump country. Tell him to drink the water. Judge, do you think that? Kamala is just relying on the media for an opposition dump, which we're seeing now every day. They're going to dump something. Oh, yeah. Somebody said this. They don't actually have tape, but somebody said this about somebody else. Blah, blah, blah. You know, it was interesting when I think it was at Ethocanadase of funeral. It's illegal. Do you remember? Yeah, it's so. Ethocanadase. Ethocanadase. Where the lipreaders said that Joe Biden says something like, I couldn't do better in Obama since we still have time. Well, right now there are 13 days left. And Harold, with all due respect, she may be uncomfortable with certain questions. But the presidency is about kind of rolling with whatever question comes at you. And she has already proven to the American people that she is incapable of articulating number one how she would be different from Joe Biden, other than to say, I'm not Joe Biden. And she cannot articulate what we also, which is that Joe Biden is a disaster. He's like, and why isn't anybody talking about the 25th Amendment now, which I find incredible that this guy is still running the country? But she is going to end on a negative note. She's going to end on the Hitler note. She's going to end on the threats to democracy note. When in truth, she started as this joy candidate. And it's so bad right now. She's in the darkness. In the sense that the American people who know they're worse off than they were four years ago, a question she's not able to answer, who know 79% of them that the country's going in the wrong direction. They can't even get empathy from this woman. They can't even get, you know what, a Bill Clinton, I feel you're paying, we're going to make it better for you. I understand if all she's closing with, he's Hitler, and this guy is creative enough, smart enough, and malleable enough to go to McDonald's. I think he got 300 million hits on TikTok, on McDonald's. I mean, the guy can roll with it. She cannot, and that's why people are saying, you know, that she is incapable at this point of doing anything that can benefit her. And remember, there were an all-end on this. There was the Obama people, the Biden people, and the Kamala Harris people. Who was going to run the campaign? They were all fighting about it. I don't know who's running it, but they're basically saying it's like a first-time congressional campaign. It's a mess.

'How did we get here?': Liberal pundits beginning to fear Trump win,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a7qPNAnDVE,2024-10-23 19:00:03+00:00,Will Kamala Harris be D-nom for VP on Election Day?,0.6367833018302917," Jason Chaffetz, Fox News contributor and former Republican Congressman from Utah. So, how important is this issue? And isn't it also interesting that while Kamala Harris has to deal with how different or not different she is from Joe Biden, something else is heating up. And that is the fact that she's focused all of her energy now on Trump. Well, that's the only thing she's got. She doesn't have any policy that's going to compel people to come to the polls. She's upside down on everything. Everything she told us, every single step of the way about the economy, about safety, about security, about the border, about inflation, about what's going on overseas. She's just absolutely backwards. She has no plan to deal with energy. She has no plan to deal with the legal immigration. So, of course, the only thing you're going to go with is being anti-Trump. And look, these last few days, they've been really bad days for Kamala Harris. And what she actually has to do in interview and answer a question, she makes things worse, not better. So, talk to me a little bit about, you know, the down stretch. You've held office before. You've been, you know, you've campaigned and you were a chairman of a committee. So, the campaign continues even once you're on the hill, I would imagine. So, what is this last stretch of 13 days, supposed to look like for these candidates? And you say she's failing. How do you measure that? Well, she took the day off yesterday. That's a pretty bad sign. She has three senators on the Democratic side of the aisle or wannabe senators, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, running ads touting their proximity to Donald Trump in his economic plan. They don't mention Kamala Harris. They mentioned Donald Trump. That's a really, really bad sign if you're trying to become the next president of the United States of America. And everybody in the world saw the mental decline of Joe Biden over the last year. So, it for her to say, oh, I didn't see anything. Are you kidding me? It was there for everybody to see. There's a reason why he was booted out of the party and she was installed. And she kept be candid about that. That just leads you to believe she's not going to be candid about anything that really matters. Yeah. Well, again, 13 days to go in some Democrats. You said it first. She was off yesterday. No, she said, you know, her team said on her behalf. She was getting ready for the Telemundo interviews, so on and so forth. She had a couple of interviews. But Democrats saw them are really not happy about this move. The Harris campaign is planning to take more time off or out on this final stretch to make some red state stops. Vice President Kamala Harris, who heads to Pennsylvania today, will hold a rally in Texas on Friday. Her running mate, Governor Walls, will hit Kentucky and the Second Gentlemen visits Florida. Not one of those states is in play for Kamala Harris. So, it's not time off, but it is time out from shoring up her blue wall. Democrats are essentially freaking out over deadlocked polling between the VP and former Vice President Trump. And former President Obama had an interesting take on the current numbers. We know this election is going to be tight. It was a country we've been through a lot over the last few years. We forget sometimes. A historic pandemic wreaked havoc on communities, on families, on businesses. And then disruptions from the pandemic cause price heights. The Wall Street Journal writes this, Democrats are growing more anxious over deadlocked race, Harris's inability to establish a lead in potential cracks in blue wall states, or stirring fears in a party scarred by its 2016 loss. Journalists from outlet after outlet now reporting the warning signs are clear for the Vice President. On cue, some in the liberal media, melting down a bit. I'm starting to worry about the polls because I say a lot of the media are saying that he's leading and everybody's getting nervous and all that. That's why they're saying it. But they're doing that on purpose. Yes, I don't understand how my fellow Americans, I don't even understand how this election is close. How did we get here? How is the race this close? This race will be far too close. Because unfortunately, we do have a fascist groundswell in parts of this country, mainly among white men. Why is basically every public pollster saying the election is way too close to call? In other words, what is this election really about? What is it that's going on here that is allowed this election to be so close? Wow, blaming black men, white men, do they not like men voters at this point because they can't woo them? I mean, this is a lot. They've never understood the American voter. And hey, Kamil Harris, why don't you come campaign in Provo Utah? See how that goes for you? Maybe that'll help drive you to victory. The idea that she's spending time and states that she has absolutely no chance of winning is stunning. She did an event with Liz Cheney. I thought her whole campaign was supposed to be about joy. Are you kidding me? Do you think anybody follows Liz Cheney out there and says, oh goodness, that was joyful. That was really good. That this makes absolutely no sense. It's one of the worst run campaigns. The problem is Kamil Harris is the problem. More Kamil Harris means she loses votes. More Cal Bell leads to her declining in the polls. So I think the campaign has said hide her. Don't put her out there. Don't do interviews. Go to states that don't matter. And hopefully people will not see and hear you. It's exactly what happened in 2020. She came out strong. She was right at the top. She was raising the most money. And yet she was the first to drop out because the more people heard from her, the more they disliked her to the point she had to drop out before even the first vote. And who beat her? Her boss, the one that they shoved aside. And then in an interview a few minutes ago, as we showed, she says, you have to ask him, meaning Biden, if there's any other reason why he left other than that debate. Yeah, that's a friend. A new Washington Post poll shows slightly more registered voters in battleground states say they trust former President Trump over VP Kamil Harris to handle threats to democracy. Those numbers appeared to undercut the Vice President's argument that Trump is a threat to democracy. Yesterday, President Biden doubled down on that argument while urging people to vote. Folks, there's so much to say. So please, I know you're all vote, but please call your neighbors. Get your friends. Get your relatives. Get them to vote because this is the nation's democracy, might you depends on it. Your reaction. Yeah, that's pretty rich coming from the party that installed somebody's their nominee without getting a single vote. Again, the total opposite is true. It's just projection in the worst possible way. And by the way, put them in New Hampshire. Good. Glad he's campaigning in New Hampshire at this point. Yeah, you know what was interesting too, just real quickly to follow up on something you said. You said she's going to place this Kamil Harris now, taking time out of trying to shore up the the Democrat vote vote in those voodoo states to go to places you say she can't win. Well, maybe she's looking across the political aisle and saying, well, Trump is going to New York. Yeah, Trump is coming here because they have a real big issue with all the sourcing that went away from its own citizens. Chicago knows a little taste of this. Other blue cities do to pay the bills of the illegal immigrants that have come in. So yeah, he's going to be a Madison Square Garden. Maybe she's trying to be Trump. Yeah, it's also the media center of this country and is going to absolutely rock. And he's looking, he's actually trying to make it work for him in New York and New Jersey. And it's not without outside of his reach. Jason, chair, if it's always good to see you, thank you. Hey, everyone, I'm Emily Camponio.

Journalists from outlet after outlet now reporting the warning signs are clear for the Vice President. On cue, some in the liberal media, melting down a bit. I'm starting to worry about the polls because I say a lot of the media are saying that he's leading and everybody's getting nervous and all that. That's why they're saying it. But they're doing that on purpose. Yes, I don't understand how my fellow Americans, I don't even understand how this election is close. How did we get here? How is the race this close? This race will be far too close. Because unfortunately, we do have a fascist groundswell in parts of this country, mainly among white men. Why is basically every public pollster saying the election is way too close to call? In other words, what is this election really about? What is it that's going on here that is allowed this election to be so close? Wow, blaming black men, white men, do they not like men voters at this point because they can't woo them? I mean, this is a lot. They've never understood the American voter. And hey, Kamil Harris, why don't you come campaign in Provo Utah? See how that goes for you? Maybe that'll help drive you to victory. The idea that she's spending time and states that she has absolutely no chance of winning is stunning. She did an event with Liz Cheney. I thought her whole campaign was supposed to be about joy. Are you kidding me? Do you think anybody follows Liz Cheney out there and says, oh goodness, that was joyful. That was really good. That this makes absolutely no sense. It's one of the worst run campaigns. The problem is Kamil Harris is the problem. More Kamil Harris means she loses votes. More Cal Bell leads to her declining in the polls. So I think the campaign has said hide her. Don't put her out there. Don't do interviews. Go to states that don't matter. And hopefully people will not see and hear you. It's exactly what happened in 2020. She came out strong. She was right at the top. She was raising the most money. And yet she was the first to drop out because the more people heard from her, the more they disliked her to the point she had to drop out before even the first vote. And who beat her? Her boss, the one that they shoved aside. And then in an interview a few minutes ago, as we showed, she says, you have to ask him, meaning Biden, if there's any other reason why he left other than that debate. Yeah, that's a friend. A new Washington Post poll shows slightly more registered voters in battleground states say they trust former President Trump over VP Kamil Harris to handle threats to democracy. Those numbers appeared to undercut the Vice President's argument that Trump is a threat to democracy. Yesterday, President Biden doubled down on that argument while urging people to vote. Folks, there's so much to say. So please, I know you're all vote, but please call your neighbors. Get your friends. Get your relatives. Get them to vote because this is the nation's democracy, might you depends on it. Your reaction. Yeah, that's pretty rich coming from the party that installed somebody's their nominee without getting a single vote. Again, the total opposite is true. It's just projection in the worst possible way. And by the way, put them in New Hampshire. Good. Glad he's campaigning in New Hampshire at this point. Yeah, you know what was interesting too, just real quickly to follow up on something you said. You said she's going to place this Kamil Harris now, taking time out of trying to shore up the the Democrat vote vote in those voodoo states to go to places you say she can't win. Well, maybe she's looking across the political aisle and saying, well, Trump is going to New York. Yeah, Trump is coming here because they have a real big issue with all the sourcing that went away from its own citizens. Chicago knows a little taste of this. Other blue cities do to pay the bills of the illegal immigrants that have come in. So yeah, he's going to be a Madison Square Garden. Maybe she's trying to be Trump. Yeah, it's also the media center of this country and is going to absolutely rock. And he's looking, he's actually trying to make it work for him in New York and New Jersey. And it's not without outside of his reach. Jason, chair, if it's always good to see you, thank you. Hey, everyone, I'm Emily Camponio.

DeSantis warns Kamala Harris not doing well 'at all' with key group,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzed1FzDHzU,2024-10-23 16:00:50+00:00,Will Trump win Florida by 8+ points?,0.6576531529426575," President Trump promising Latino voters in Florida a secure border and an end to migrant crime while Kamala Harris uses a Telemundo interview to make her pitch to Hispanic voters. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis joins us now. Governor DeSantis great to have you this morning. I want to start with this poll of USA Today. And what you see here is Trump with an 11-point lead among Latino voters. You did extraordinarily well with Latino voters in your race for governor. Are you seeing a trend of Latinos going toward the Republican Party? Well, certainly in Florida. I think Donald Trump will do very well. He'll win his spandex. I think we won 62 or 63 percent two years ago in 2022. And I don't think Kamala Harris is going to play well at all. I think one of the things in Florida that's been exciting is, you go back when I got elected governor. There were 300,000 more registered Democrats. Now we're into this election. We have a million more registered Republicans now in Florida. And I think you're seeing Hispanic voters play a big part of that. So this is the first presidential election, certainly in modern history, where Florida is not a swing state. Florida is going to go clear red across the board. Governor, I want to talk to you about some of these amendments because they're very important in the state of Florida. I want to start with amendment four. This is the abortion initiative in Florida. And we've seen the Republican Party lose every single abortion ballot initiative across the country. And what people don't realize is the language is vague in these. It often leads to taxpayer funded abortion, no parental consent abortion until birth being legalized. It's rather radical. But in Florida, there's going to be language on the ballot explaining much of that. There's also a 60 percent threshold. Do you think you can win on amendment four? No, absolutely. I think once people figure out the things you just said, and this was written very vaguely and deceptively, it should not even be on the ballot because they're trying to fool people. Their ad campaign talks nothing about their ads. They're just lying about Florida law. One of the things in amendment four, you're exactly right. Borscht till birth will likely lead to taxpayer funding. It eliminates parental consent for minors, which is absolutely extreme and radical. But it does something that I don't even think California or Colorado or some of these states did. It allows non-physicians to green light abortions up until the moment of birth. And they had always talked about the importance of the physician. So we've got a lot of physicians in Florida who are speaking out against it. So if you're pro-life, obviously this isn't easy. No, but even if you're not, I don't know very many people who want to see abortion till birth or think that physicians should be displaced in favor of health care provider, which you and I know can be a whole host of different things short of a licensed physician. Sure. Another amendment that's very important is amendment three. And we're going to put up what amendment three would mean. And this is about legal weed. And Governor DeSantis, one thing, a case that your team is making is that this would not limited public places. So as Florida going to start smelling like New York, God forbid, if this passes. That will happen, yes. And here's the thing. So this is the amendment. How did this get here? That's one big weed company has spent $100 million. And they wrote the amendment to benefit them, not to benefit the people of Florida. So this is not about freedom because they don't let you grow your own weed. If you want to do that in your backyard, you got to buy it from them. They create a big weed cartel. But on the other hand, they don't limit use in public. So you will see rampant use. So to me, this is anti-freedom. They don't let you grow your own. But on the other hand, people that don't want to be involved in marijuana will have their freedoms infringed upon when this is in our parks, on our beaches, just like it is in Colorado, in California, in places like that. And I would say this is a horribly written amendment. If you don't like weed, obviously you vote no. But even if you do, you have to read the actual text. This amendment actually gives the big weed companies total immunity from any civil liability. So if they sell you bad weed, you can't sue them. This is not something that should be in a constitution in the state of Florida. We have medical marijuana that's legal in Florida. People can get cards and do it. But we have not let it run rampant around our state and infring on people's quality of life. If this amendment passes, it will reduce the quality of life in the state of Florida. There's no question. Well, the text does matter. And I actually saw on that amendment 4 about abortion, a pro-choice voter saying in an ad why she was voting against it. So very interesting, very important governor to Santis. Thank you as always. I'm Steve Ducy. I'm Brian Kilme. And I'm meansly, Earhart.

Jesse Watters: Kamala Harris takes the day off but calls Trump 'exhausted'?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6yVJbDV2SY,2024-10-23 01:30:22+00:00,Will Kamala Harris be D-nom for VP on Election Day?,0.6164786219596863," Two weeks to go until election day and Democrats just yanked Kamala Harris off the campaign trail. She took the day off. Zero campaign events today. And the only thing on her schedule? Two interviews, not even live. She spent all day preparing because that last interview with Brett, not that great. Or maybe she wasn't preparing at all. We'll show you the interview's later, and you can decide for yourself. Trump says maybe she was getting her beauty rest. She's sleeping right now. She couldn't go on the trail. You know, you think when you have 14 days left, you wouldn't be sleeping. Think of it. I said, where is she campaigning today, sir? She's got a day off. You have 14 days left for the presidency. She's taking a day off. This is not what you want. This is not what you want. I can't get over it. Who the hell takes off? You have 14 days left. And she'll take a couple of more days off, too. You know why she's lazy as hell? And she's got that reputation. Let me see if we have this right. Kamala calls Trump exhausted and then takes the day off. McDonald's football games, barbershops, town halls, round tables, rallies. You've seen them. Kamala today didn't talk to a single voter. She stayed home in DC. And the media is getting nervous. You know, everybody I talk to says, you know, I have to turn off the news. I can't read anything. I'm meditating. I'm doing yoga. I'm doing, I'm so anxious. I just don't even know. I'm eating gummies, all kinds of things, you know. What are you doing? What are you doing? How do you do? How do you do me? What? What? OK. We got back there. All right. No gummies. Maybe she spent the day doing yoga. Because if she was preparing for the NBC interview, didn't look like it. And never saw anything like what happened at the debate night behind closed doors with him? It was a bad debate. People have bad debates. That he is absolutely, but that's the reason why you're here, and he's not running for the top of the ticket. Well, you'd have to ask him if that's the only reason why. What do you think? I am running for President of the United States. Joe Biden is not. And my presidency will be about bringing a new generation of leadership to America that is focused on the work that we need to do to invest in the ambitions and aspirations of the American people. It's a judgment question. That's why I ask, can the American people trust you in these moments, even when it's maybe uncomfortable for Americans to have to level with Americans in that way? So that's why I ask, and it sounds like what you're saying, is you feel like you never saw anything like that from President Biden. I have worked with Joe Biden whether it could hours and hours and hours over these four years, whether it be in the situation room or the Oval Office. I speak with not only sincerity, but with a real first-hand account of watching him do this work. I have no reluctance in saying that. No, of course I don't. Kamala's trapped because if she says she noticed Biden's decline, she's guilty of a cover-up. But if she says she didn't notice, everyone knows she's just a liar. So she's a liar either way. And then she said the American dream was dead. Are the last four years an obstacle to you in this race? Here's how I look at it. First of all, let me be very clear. Mine will not be a continuation of the Biden administration. I bring my own experiences, my own ideas to it. And it has informed a number of my areas of focus, most of which are on to your point lowering costs. I haven't traveled in the country. I am very clear. Cost of groceries still too high. The voters know it. I know it. The whole part of my plan includes what we need to do to bring down the price of groceries, including the work I will do dealing with price gouging, something I dealt with when I was attorney general, something I will deal with going forward. Cost of housing. You know, I'm speaking with people of every background and every area of the country of every age. And you know, the idea of the American dream was something that previous generations could count on, not as much anymore. To the other week, she said she couldn't think of anything she'd do differently than Biden. And now she says her administration wouldn't be a continuation. OK, if Kamala had ideas about bringing prices down, why didn't she share them with Biden? Why'd she tell us Bidenomics was working? None of this makes any sense. We're happy Kamala go. She doesn't look like she's enjoying running for president. She definitely wasn't ready to run for president. Yesterday, she said, guys, you're scared and so am I. If I can just speak to what people are feeling, we cannot despair. We cannot despair. And I say do not despair because in a democracy as long as we can keep it in our democracy, the people, every individual has the power to make a decision about what this will be. And so let's not feel powerless. Let's not let the some, and I get it, overwhelming nature of this all make us feel powerless because then we have been defeated. Is that the saddest looking town hall you've ever seen? Democrats are starting to ask, what if Joe Biden was the better candidate all along? They want a coup do over. Kamala Harris is not a godsend, all right? You people didn't even like her six months ago. Now all of a sudden, she's black female Jesus. The way Obama was black Jesus. And let me tell you something, he had a lot more going for him than Kamala Harris does. And not just his first go, but his type of campaigning, his type of persuasion, his charisma. So while Harris takes the day off from campaigning, the real Messiah is feeling her shoes or heels. Barry went to Wisconsin and Michigan today, but he sounded bitter. Real strengths about work and hard. Real strengths about taking responsibility for your actions. Real strengths about telling the truth even when it's inconvenient. Real strength is about helping people who need it and standing up for those who can't stand up for themselves. That's what we should want for our daughters and our sons. That's what I want in the president of the United States. Yeah, he has a guilty conscience after shivving Scranton Joe for a woman who can't even tell you what a woman is. They're even dragging Michelle kicking and screaming out of her Hawaiian mansion to say this is the second time she's proud of the country. Where's Michelle been since the convention? If democracy was really on the line, shouldn't Michelle be living in the battlegrounds instead of Honolulu? Every musician is now being ordered to campaign for Kamala after Usher, Lizzo, Stevie Wonder. The Harris campaigns bring it out Bruce Springsteen for a concert series. Oh, and Baroque's bringing out Eminem and Detroit. Eminem endorsing Kamala. Does somebody have something on him? Earlier in the day, actor Bradley Whitford from the West Wing put on quite the performance. What's up, Mercedes? 65,000 rape victims. He was laughing. He was laughing. Massagerie is at the reptilian brainstem of white Christian nationalism. Yeah. And that is what we are up against. What's next? Is he going to yank his pinky off and light it like a cigarette? And how lucky are we? How lucky are we to have Kamala Harris attempt to loss? If things are so great under the Biden Harris administration, so great that it should continue. Why is everybody so angry? Why isn't it mourning in America again? The Harris campaigns running out of ideas and time. According to CNN, their closing strategy is to count on Trump making outlandish claims. Yeah, you can count on that. But that's a strategy that has nothing to do with Kamala Harris or the American people for that matter. That's like asking Dan a compatriot, how are you going to win the Daytona 500? And she says, I'm hoping the guy in the lead crashes. Well, if that doesn't work, Biden has a better idea. I think he has the right to have the Supreme Court ruling on immunity to be able, if need to be able to be able to actually eliminate, physically eliminate, shoot, kill someone who is, he believes it may be a threat to him. I mean, so I know the sounds bizarre. It sounds like I said this five years ago, you'd lock me up. We got to lock him up. Now we know he's definitely sabotaging her.

Jesse Watters: Kamala Harris takes the day off but calls Trump 'exhausted'?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6yVJbDV2SY,2024-10-23 01:30:22+00:00,Will Kamala Harris drop out of presidential race?,0.6086892485618591," Two weeks to go until election day and Democrats just yanked Kamala Harris off the campaign trail. She took the day off. Zero campaign events today. And the only thing on her schedule? Two interviews, not even live. She spent all day preparing because that last interview with Brett, not that great. Or maybe she wasn't preparing at all. We'll show you the interview's later, and you can decide for yourself. Trump says maybe she was getting her beauty rest. She's sleeping right now. She couldn't go on the trail. You know, you think when you have 14 days left, you wouldn't be sleeping. Think of it. I said, where is she campaigning today, sir? She's got a day off. You have 14 days left for the presidency. She's taking a day off. This is not what you want. This is not what you want.

"Black voters, vulnerable Dems running away from Harris in final weeks of campaign",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXqWckp-upA,2024-10-22 13:45:03+00:00,Trump gets more black voters than in 2020?,0.6179170608520508," So just two weeks to the election day and New Poll show Vice President Kamala Harris losing ground with crucial blocks in her party. They have always counted on the Latino voters, but they're now voting for Donald Trump. By double digits, the same poll showing her support among black voters hitting a record low with just 72% of them back in here. To put it in that in perspective, that's down 92% that's down from 92% from black voters support of the Democratic candidate back in 2016. Fox News contributing for him, the Democrat Leo Tarell joins us now. So I found this poll just fascinating, Leo. When you look at the support for Hillary Clinton, it was 92% of black support. When you look for Joe Biden, it was 90%. You got Kamala Harris at 78%. The question is why? Oh, it's very simple. Thanks for having me, Lawrence. It's not in their best interests. It's not in the interests of blacks and Hispanics to vote for Kamala Harris. She hurts them economically. They have seen nothing in progress over the last four years. And I wanna be very clear, the whole notion of the race car that Trump is racist is dead. It no longer works. And if he is a racist, why are Hispanics and blacks drifting towards him? Because of situation like the barbershop yesterday where you were with him at the barbershop and blacks and Hispanics resonate with him. And he resonates with them. And I'll see there and tell you, I left the Democrats in 2020, voted for Trump, and voted for him already. That is what's happening, a shift. Economically is in blacks and Latinos' interests to vote for Donald J. Trump. Well, it's strange too, because she's not speaking to that issue. Even with her plan for black males, she doesn't address the reason why black folks are turning to Donald Trump, especially the black males. But I wanna get to this because I found a very interesting and a Democrat in these tough races are now crediting Donald Trump, trying to link themselves to it. Here's a montage, watch. This is wild to me. I don't see Republicans trying to link themselves to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. Lawrence, I thought Donald Trump was a threat to democracy. I thought he was a danger to this country. What you did, and Bob Casey voted to impeach him twice. What you saw here was an admission from Democrats that Trump policies work for America, and they're running away from Kamala Harris. They're running away from Joe Biden. They're running away from the Democrat policy. This is an outright admission that Donald Trump has a policy that will make all Americans great regardless of skin color or ethnicity. Yeah, people keep asking me, do you believe the polls that Donald Trump is taking advantage? And I say, I don't have to look at the polls. I'm looking at the Democrats change their messaging. That tells me everything that I need to know. Leo, thanks so much for joining the program this morning. Thank you, Lawrence. Thanks for having me. I'm Steve Juicy. I'm Brian Kilme.

She commutes to work on her soap bubble. To those of Americans who room in the vibe, Dana Brito. Oh. He enjoys liberal winers. Wow, looking like a miner. Host of the Guy Benson Show, Guy Benson. She's got a running tab at Lens Crafters. Who's the Kennedy State Toural Podcast Kennedy? And his act is like a fine wine. Old. The founder of DUTC.com, I'd be loved to hear that. Dana, I think there's a realization going on. By the way, good to see you. It's been a couple hours. Are they suddenly realizing that it's not just Trump is a big, meany problem? It's Kamala is a problem. Yeah, I think that they see her losing air speed and altitude and they're realizing that this is all not going to go the way that they think it's going to go. Now, let me say with the caveat, I don't know what's going to happen. And it is a tide race. It is getting closer. But the momentum definitely feels like it did in 2016. That's not a scientific poll. Great point about internal polls. Like, why don't we just put out the internal polls? Yeah. I mean, that's a good point, I have to say. I should have said, wow. You should have. Like, what if you and I just like all day were like, wow. We? We once impersonated Mika and Joe for a taping. And. Hey, Tonya. Yeah. I had a hard time. We much should revive that. Because they're idiots. I mean, really? Yeah, I'm glad they're together. Because they saved two other idiots from being miserable. That's right. I mean, like, misery loves company. And they've got plenty of it. Yes, that's true. Guy, great to see you. Do you have any caveats as well? I do. I want to tell a quick story based on your intro of me and my appearance. So I was at an event overseas. And I was done with the event, flying home. I looked the worst. I looked gross. And I'm getting on the plane and putting my luggage up. And this woman kept looking at me in a sort of unusual way. And finally, she was talking to her husband in German. So you finally come up to me. She said, Greg is right. Even with a beard, very young. LAUGHTER I was not expecting that. So that sort of made my day. I knew you would like that story. I would. I like it when you do a German accent. Can you do that later at the hot tub? LAUGHTER Guy, tell me I've been very bad. We can negotiate my fee, perhaps, on that. But here's the thing about the McDonald's experience. I feel, and maybe people disagree, I feel like I cannot wait for this election to be over. I'm over it. I want it to be done. But yesterday, it was actually fun. And I was like, I could do a little more of this. Yeah. And you could tell he was having fun. And I think nothing makes them angrier than that. The photos, too, look like they were like the photos of him doing it. It was art. I mean, you couldn't create that. And when he said, when they were asking him, like, what's your favorite McDonald's item, it was not a political dodge. He means it. He loves all of them. Yeah, he's like, I love all of them. He actually does, right? He's sampled it all. He's turning into your grandmother. Do you notice that? Mother? Mother. Why? Not father. He's very menchise, turning into a grandmother, not a father. Oh, Greg, he's not going to like that. I know. Kennedy. Do you, how do you think Kamala would have done at the, if she did this, if she actually worked? I think she would have turned into my grandmother who was dead. I don't, I don't think it would have ended well. I think, I think it would have been committing political suicide. And she knows that because if she thought she could do it, she would have done it because that would have been a layup for her side. Because again, she would have gone in there and the people who were working there, they loved it. The people who went to visit him, they had the best time ever. We were on Dana and Bill show this morning talking about how we all ate French fries yesterday because we were having so much fun. But I'll tell you why he's having fun. He knows this is his last election ever. So if he wins the presidency, he has four more years. If he doesn't, then the RNC showed he's got this great family who's probably very eager to be spending time with him without the pressure, especially considering the two assassination attempts. Now, for any other person on earth, if they had almost been murdered in cold blood, I think it might have dampened their spirits. But the fact that he finds joy in this and, and hope in this, I hope that says something because the way he responded to people yesterday was not to similar to how he responded on July 13th when he stood up and raised his fist and yelled, fight, fight, fight. And what I'm saying is in the moment, he was able to capitalize on something and give people what he wanted to give them genuinely and they were happy to receive it. Well put, well put. Uh. APPLAUSE Michael, did you get any inspiration watching Trump at McDonald's who actually consider finding a job now? Getting on, getting on that first rung of the employment ladder, getting that minimum wage, you only have to be there for a few months. It's going to cramp my stuff. I need to be out there living my best life by the dumpster. You know, finding the good cardboard boxes, making a new house, traveling. I love this, uh, this trumpet McDonald's thing that really made my weekend. It was, it was fantastic. So many jokes were flying around. You were like, oh, he's going to fix the ice cream machine, this election's over. And you're like, yeah! People like, he gave me seven nuggets in my six piece. Yeah! He was playing basketball. And like, being like, oh, Kamala, she's going to be working at five guys. And I'm like, yeah, no. We don't do that? No. No. You know? Everyone knows she's going to be working it in and out. No! Oh! Wow! Oh! It was like Christmas yesterday. Trump could, he had to do this at a new McDonald's, the boxy gray ones. He couldn't do this, like, at the old ones. They have a sloped roof and, you know, sicker, dumbass. It would have been like, we don't know what to do. It was fantastic. And here's what drives the elitist's crazy, a permanent Washington and the media as well. They can't wrap their brains around it that Trump would come off the sidelines. It's like as a regular guy and do such a great job. America was kicking ass in 2016, 2017, during his, you know, 10-year-old president. And now he can do it all. Dude's coming back. I'll work at McDonald's. Bring me in. I'll do the fries. I'll have a great time. It was awesome and I want more. All right. And you will get more.

Getting on, getting on that first rung of the employment ladder, getting that minimum wage, you only have to be there for a few months. It's going to cramp my stuff. I need to be out there living my best life by the dumpster. You know, finding the good cardboard boxes, making a new house, traveling. I love this, uh, this trumpet McDonald's thing that really made my weekend. It was, it was fantastic. So many jokes were flying around. You were like, oh, he's going to fix the ice cream machine, this election's over. And you're like, yeah! People like, he gave me seven nuggets in my six piece. Yeah! He was playing basketball. And like, being like, oh, Kamala, she's going to be working at five guys. And I'm like, yeah, no. We don't do that? No. No. You know? Everyone knows she's going to be working it in and out. No! Oh! Wow! Oh! It was like Christmas yesterday. Trump could, he had to do this at a new McDonald's, the boxy gray ones. He couldn't do this, like, at the old ones. They have a sloped roof and, you know, sicker, dumbass. It would have been like, we don't know what to do. It was fantastic. And here's what drives the elitist's crazy, a permanent Washington and the media as well. They can't wrap their brains around it that Trump would come off the sidelines. It's like as a regular guy and do such a great job. America was kicking ass in 2016, 2017, during his, you know, 10-year-old president. And now he can do it all. Dude's coming back. I'll work at McDonald's. Bring me in. I'll do the fries. I'll have a great time. It was awesome and I want more. All right. And you will get more.

Gutfeld!: Trump has fun at McDonalds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lVbsXXSstU,2024-10-22 04:00:05+00:00,Will Kamala Harris drop out of presidential race?,0.6423239707946777," Yeah! She commutes to work on her soap bubble. To those of Americans who room in the vibe, Dana Brito. Oh. He enjoys liberal winers. Wow, looking like a miner. Host of the Guy Benson Show, Guy Benson. She's got a running tab at Lens Crafters. Who's the Kennedy State Toural Podcast Kennedy? And his act is like a fine wine. Old. The founder of DUTC.com, I'd be loved to hear that. Dana, I think there's a realization going on. By the way, good to see you. It's been a couple hours. Are they suddenly realizing that it's not just Trump is a big, meany problem? It's Kamala is a problem. Yeah, I think that they see her losing air speed and altitude and they're realizing that this is all not going to go the way that they think it's going to go. Now, let me say with the caveat, I don't know what's going to happen. And it is a tide race. It is getting closer. But the momentum definitely feels like it did in 2016. That's not a scientific poll. Great point about internal polls. Like, why don't we just put out the internal polls? Yeah. I mean, that's a good point, I have to say. I should have said, wow. You should have. Like, what if you and I just like all day were like, wow. We? We once impersonated Mika and Joe for a taping. And. Hey, Tonya. Yeah. I had a hard time. We much should revive that. Because they're idiots. I mean, really? Yeah, I'm glad they're together. Because they saved two other idiots from being miserable. That's right. I mean, like, misery loves company. And they've got plenty of it. Yes, that's true. Guy, great to see you. Do you have any caveats as well? I do. I want to tell a quick story based on your intro of me and my appearance. So I was at an event overseas. And I was done with the event, flying home. I looked the worst. I looked gross. And I'm getting on the plane and putting my luggage up. And this woman kept looking at me in a sort of unusual way. And finally, she was talking to her husband in German. So you finally come up to me. She said, Greg is right. Even with a beard, very young. LAUGHTER I was not expecting that. So that sort of made my day. I knew you would like that story. I would. I like it when you do a German accent. Can you do that later at the hot tub? LAUGHTER Guy, tell me I've been very bad. We can negotiate my fee, perhaps, on that. But here's the thing about the McDonald's experience. I feel, and maybe people disagree, I feel like I cannot wait for this election to be over. I'm over it. I want it to be done. But yesterday, it was actually fun. And I was like, I could do a little more of this. Yeah. And you could tell he was having fun. And I think nothing makes them angrier than that. The photos, too, look like they were like the photos of him doing it. It was art. I mean, you couldn't create that. And when he said, when they were asking him, like, what's your favorite McDonald's item, it was not a political dodge. He means it. He loves all of them. Yeah, he's like, I love all of them. He actually does, right? He's sampled it all. He's turning into your grandmother. Do you notice that? Mother? Mother. Why? Not father. He's very menchise, turning into a grandmother, not a father. Oh, Greg, he's not going to like that. I know. Kennedy. Do you, how do you think Kamala would have done at the, if she did this, if she actually worked? I think she would have turned into my grandmother who was dead. I don't, I don't think it would have ended well. I think, I think it would have been committing political suicide. And she knows that because if she thought she could do it, she would have done it because that would have been a layup for her side. Because again, she would have gone in there and the people who were working there, they loved it. The people who went to visit him, they had the best time ever. We were on Dana and Bill show this morning talking about how we all ate French fries yesterday because we were having so much fun. But I'll tell you why he's having fun. He knows this is his last election ever. So if he wins the presidency, he has four more years. If he doesn't, then the RNC showed he's got this great family who's probably very eager to be spending time with him without the pressure, especially considering the two assassination attempts. Now, for any other person on earth, if they had almost been murdered in cold blood, I think it might have dampened their spirits. But the fact that he finds joy in this and, and hope in this, I hope that says something because the way he responded to people yesterday was not to similar to how he responded on July 13th when he stood up and raised his fist and yelled, fight, fight, fight. And what I'm saying is in the moment, he was able to capitalize on something and give people what he wanted to give them genuinely and they were happy to receive it. Well put, well put. Uh.

Gutfeld!: Trump has fun at McDonalds,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lVbsXXSstU,2024-10-22 04:00:05+00:00,Will Kamala Harris be D-nom for VP on Election Day?,0.6197858452796936," Yeah! She commutes to work on her soap bubble. To those of Americans who room in the vibe, Dana Brito. Oh. He enjoys liberal winers. Wow, looking like a miner. Host of the Guy Benson Show, Guy Benson. She's got a running tab at Lens Crafters. Who's the Kennedy State Toural Podcast Kennedy? And his act is like a fine wine. Old. The founder of DUTC.com, I'd be loved to hear that. Dana, I think there's a realization going on. By the way, good to see you. It's been a couple hours. Are they suddenly realizing that it's not just Trump is a big, meany problem? It's Kamala is a problem. Yeah, I think that they see her losing air speed and altitude and they're realizing that this is all not going to go the way that they think it's going to go. Now, let me say with the caveat, I don't know what's going to happen. And it is a tide race. It is getting closer. But the momentum definitely feels like it did in 2016. That's not a scientific poll. Great point about internal polls. Like, why don't we just put out the internal polls? Yeah. I mean, that's a good point, I have to say. I should have said, wow. You should have. Like, what if you and I just like all day were like, wow. We? We once impersonated Mika and Joe for a taping. And. Hey, Tonya. Yeah. I had a hard time. We much should revive that. Because they're idiots. I mean, really? Yeah, I'm glad they're together. Because they saved two other idiots from being miserable. That's right. I mean, like, misery loves company. And they've got plenty of it. Yes, that's true. Guy, great to see you. Do you have any caveats as well? I do. I want to tell a quick story based on your intro of me and my appearance. So I was at an event overseas. And I was done with the event, flying home. I looked the worst. I looked gross. And I'm getting on the plane and putting my luggage up. And this woman kept looking at me in a sort of unusual way. And finally, she was talking to her husband in German. So you finally come up to me. She said, Greg is right. Even with a beard, very young. LAUGHTER I was not expecting that. So that sort of made my day. I knew you would like that story. I would. I like it when you do a German accent. Can you do that later at the hot tub? LAUGHTER Guy, tell me I've been very bad. We can negotiate my fee, perhaps, on that. But here's the thing about the McDonald's experience. I feel, and maybe people disagree, I feel like I cannot wait for this election to be over. I'm over it. I want it to be done. But yesterday, it was actually fun. And I was like, I could do a little more of this. Yeah. And you could tell he was having fun. And I think nothing makes them angrier than that. The photos, too, look like they were like the photos of him doing it. It was art. I mean, you couldn't create that. And when he said, when they were asking him, like, what's your favorite McDonald's item, it was not a political dodge. He means it. He loves all of them. Yeah, he's like, I love all of them. He actually does, right? He's sampled it all. He's turning into your grandmother. Do you notice that? Mother? Mother. Why? Not father. He's very menchise, turning into a grandmother, not a father. Oh, Greg, he's not going to like that. I know. Kennedy. Do you, how do you think Kamala would have done at the, if she did this, if she actually worked? I think she would have turned into my grandmother who was dead. I don't, I don't think it would have ended well. I think, I think it would have been committing political suicide. And she knows that because if she thought she could do it, she would have done it because that would have been a layup for her side. Because again, she would have gone in there and the people who were working there, they loved it. The people who went to visit him, they had the best time ever. We were on Dana and Bill show this morning talking about how we all ate French fries yesterday because we were having so much fun. But I'll tell you why he's having fun. He knows this is his last election ever. So if he wins the presidency, he has four more years. If he doesn't, then the RNC showed he's got this great family who's probably very eager to be spending time with him without the pressure, especially considering the two assassination attempts. Now, for any other person on earth, if they had almost been murdered in cold blood, I think it might have dampened their spirits. But the fact that he finds joy in this and, and hope in this, I hope that says something because the way he responded to people yesterday was not to similar to how he responded on July 13th when he stood up and raised his fist and yelled, fight, fight, fight. And what I'm saying is in the moment, he was able to capitalize on something and give people what he wanted to give them genuinely and they were happy to receive it. Well put, well put. Uh. APPLAUSE Michael, did you get any inspiration watching Trump at McDonald's who actually consider finding a job now? Getting on, getting on that first rung of the employment ladder, getting that minimum wage, you only have to be there for a few months. It's going to cramp my stuff. I need to be out there living my best life by the dumpster. You know, finding the good cardboard boxes, making a new house, traveling. I love this, uh, this trumpet McDonald's thing that really made my weekend. It was, it was fantastic. So many jokes were flying around. You were like, oh, he's going to fix the ice cream machine, this election's over. And you're like, yeah! People like, he gave me seven nuggets in my six piece. Yeah! He was playing basketball. And like, being like, oh, Kamala, she's going to be working at five guys. And I'm like, yeah, no. We don't do that? No. No. You know? Everyone knows she's going to be working it in and out. No! Oh! Wow! Oh! It was like Christmas yesterday. Trump could, he had to do this at a new McDonald's, the boxy gray ones. He couldn't do this, like, at the old ones. They have a sloped roof and, you know, sicker, dumbass. It would have been like, we don't know what to do. It was fantastic. And here's what drives the elitist's crazy, a permanent Washington and the media as well. They can't wrap their brains around it that Trump would come off the sidelines. It's like as a regular guy and do such a great job. America was kicking ass in 2016, 2017, during his, you know, 10-year-old president. And now he can do it all. Dude's coming back. I'll work at McDonald's. Bring me in. I'll do the fries. I'll have a great time. It was awesome and I want more. All right. And you will get more.

And they've got plenty of it. Yes, that's true. Guy, great to see you. Do you have any caveats as well? I do. I want to tell a quick story based on your intro of me and my appearance. So I was at an event overseas. And I was done with the event, flying home. I looked the worst. I looked gross. And I'm getting on the plane and putting my luggage up. And this woman kept looking at me in a sort of unusual way. And finally, she was talking to her husband in German. So you finally come up to me. She said, Greg is right. Even with a beard, very young. LAUGHTER I was not expecting that. So that sort of made my day. I knew you would like that story. I would. I like it when you do a German accent. Can you do that later at the hot tub? LAUGHTER Guy, tell me I've been very bad. We can negotiate my fee, perhaps, on that. But here's the thing about the McDonald's experience. I feel, and maybe people disagree, I feel like I cannot wait for this election to be over. I'm over it. I want it to be done. But yesterday, it was actually fun. And I was like, I could do a little more of this. Yeah. And you could tell he was having fun. And I think nothing makes them angrier than that. The photos, too, look like they were like the photos of him doing it. It was art. I mean, you couldn't create that. And when he said, when they were asking him, like, what's your favorite McDonald's item, it was not a political dodge. He means it. He loves all of them. Yeah, he's like, I love all of them. He actually does, right? He's sampled it all. He's turning into your grandmother. Do you notice that? Mother? Mother. Why? Not father. He's very menchise, turning into a grandmother, not a father. Oh, Greg, he's not going to like that. I know. Kennedy. Do you, how do you think Kamala would have done at the, if she did this, if she actually worked? I think she would have turned into my grandmother who was dead. I don't, I don't think it would have ended well. I think, I think it would have been committing political suicide. And she knows that because if she thought she could do it, she would have done it because that would have been a layup for her side. Because again, she would have gone in there and the people who were working there, they loved it. The people who went to visit him, they had the best time ever. We were on Dana and Bill show this morning talking about how we all ate French fries yesterday because we were having so much fun. But I'll tell you why he's having fun. He knows this is his last election ever. So if he wins the presidency, he has four more years. If he doesn't, then the RNC showed he's got this great family who's probably very eager to be spending time with him without the pressure, especially considering the two assassination attempts. Now, for any other person on earth, if they had almost been murdered in cold blood, I think it might have dampened their spirits. But the fact that he finds joy in this and, and hope in this, I hope that says something because the way he responded to people yesterday was not to similar to how he responded on July 13th when he stood up and raised his fist and yelled, fight, fight, fight. And what I'm saying is in the moment, he was able to capitalize on something and give people what he wanted to give them genuinely and they were happy to receive it. Well put, well put. Uh. APPLAUSE Michael, did you get any inspiration watching Trump at McDonald's who actually consider finding a job now? Getting on, getting on that first rung of the employment ladder, getting that minimum wage, you only have to be there for a few months. It's going to cramp my stuff. I need to be out there living my best life by the dumpster. You know, finding the good cardboard boxes, making a new house, traveling. I love this, uh, this trumpet McDonald's thing that really made my weekend. It was, it was fantastic. So many jokes were flying around. You were like, oh, he's going to fix the ice cream machine, this election's over. And you're like, yeah! People like, he gave me seven nuggets in my six piece. Yeah! He was playing basketball. And like, being like, oh, Kamala, she's going to be working at five guys. And I'm like, yeah, no. We don't do that? No. No. You know? Everyone knows she's going to be working it in and out. No! Oh! Wow! Oh! It was like Christmas yesterday. Trump could, he had to do this at a new McDonald's, the boxy gray ones. He couldn't do this, like, at the old ones. They have a sloped roof and, you know, sicker, dumbass. It would have been like, we don't know what to do. It was fantastic. And here's what drives the elitist's crazy, a permanent Washington and the media as well. They can't wrap their brains around it that Trump would come off the sidelines. It's like as a regular guy and do such a great job. America was kicking ass in 2016, 2017, during his, you know, 10-year-old president. And now he can do it all. Dude's coming back. I'll work at McDonald's. Bring me in. I'll do the fries. I'll have a great time. It was awesome and I want more. All right. And you will get more.

Judge Jeanine: Nobody cares what leftist Hollywood elites think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axzMVHUyFSM,2024-10-22 00:15:01+00:00,Kamala Harris fires campaign manager?,0.6538873910903931," 15 days to go and Kamala momentum is in the toilet. VP Harris looking to Hollywood a rescuer stalled out campaign. Over the weekend, she was rolling out the star power with Lizzo. That's her on the left. Usher and Stevie Wonder. And later this week, she got the Democratic Dream team of Barry and Michelle. Oh, but there's one big name missing in this coconut party. The Harris campaign is said to be abandoning Joe Biden in the final weeks before election day with no current plans for Kamala to campaign with the big guy. But she is hitting up Al Sharpton to whine about Trump. A role model of what it means to be committed to certain standards, including international rules and norms, but also standards of decorum. And what you see in my opponent, a former president of the United States, really is, it means the office. Do you think some of the resistance of some men, Black and White, is misogynist? I have the support of countless Black men who are in elected positions. I am very clear. I must earn, earn the vote of everyone, regardless of their race or gender. So Joe Sharpton is a staunch defender of decorum and misogyny. I would call them the rose of parks of hate crime hoaxes. You can forget his dedicated defense of Tawana Brawley in 1987, which launched a whole litany all the way up to Justice Smollett. So in a sense, he really is a forerunner. You are so right, Greg. I must tell you, your knowledge of history, as it relates to Al Sharpton, is really incredible. A parallel. Yes, it is unparalleled. You know, let me just tell you something. I mean, Kamala Harris, it's kind of interesting to hear her say she's been clear that she wants to earn everybody's vote. I mean, she ought to go out there and really try to earn it as opposed to, you know, just reading scripted speeches at rallies. But more than that, I mean, calling on the Hollywood elite, calling on Bill Clinton. He didn't do her any favors. He basically said, like, and Riley wouldn't be dead if there was any vetting. That's no good. And Obama didn't do her any help because Obama's the one who was talking down to Black men saying, you know, you got to vote for this woman, you know, in lecturing them about voting for a woman, a Black woman for president. I made such crap. Plus, celebrities, no one listens to celebrities anymore. Nobody cares about what they think. Everybody knows that the Hollywood elite are leftist. And, you know, being a celebrity is nothing more than a distraction. The voters want to know who Kamala Harris is. And they don't know it yet because she won't let them know that. It's all about platitudes and word salads that we've been dealt with over the last three years, three and a half years. But in Trump's running circles around her, but I got to make one more comment. It's Lizzo. If you ever need a proof of someone being more out of touch with Americans, when she says, yeah, we're going to make America like Detroit. You know, and it'll be, it'll be, it'll be terrific. I mean, unless she's talking about making Detroit great again as in a manga, making America great again, nobody's interested in Detroit the way it is. I mean, 33, 34% of the people are below the poverty line. They don't have jobs, the crime is through the room. You know, I got to disagree with the judge, Dana. Celebrities do matter to me. If it's Philip Michael Thomas, who played tubs in Miami Vice, tells me who vote for. I'm there with you, Philip Michael Thomas. What do you think about? You think that celebrities can replace policy? Nope. No. No. Never has. And I'm not swayed by it. And I obviously other people haven't been either. One thing I'll say about Kamala Harris, throughout this campaign, she doesn't play the woman card or the race card. She always says, I want to earn this on the merits. And that's refreshing because that's not what 2016 was like at all. The other thing, I was going to make the Detroit point, but I won't do that now. The other thing is I feel like this idea that she doesn't want to campaign with Biden, that was going to be an inevitable storyline. But Biden should help her do this. So when he finally said, okay, I'm going to give this speech, even if it was under duress, he was making a decision that she was going to be the heir apparent. So what he should have done, knowing that this storyline was coming is to say, it's okay. I know you are loyal to me. And it is okay if you disinjusted yourself from me. There's three possible items where you could say something that will maybe look like it hurts my feelings, but in the long run, if it helps you win, that will be better for me. And so I think that that burden kind of goes back to the Biden White House and they haven't been trying to help her at all. Last thing I would say is she's doing a lot of things, but do not confuse movement with progress. Because it feels like right now after the convention, she was on this glide path to victory. But Donald Trump's been gaining. And it's like, well, who's going to get to election day at the top? That's like an algebra problem. It really is. I will take a disagree with you. I do think that she does play the race card, which he changes her accents. Isn't she playing the race card? Lots of races. And a lot of her issues are race based. The plan for black men just took this stuff that didn't work. Yeah, but she's not saying vote for me because I'm black. Really? Really? Well, let me ignore that comment. Go to Jesse. Yeah. Lizzo Usher, Stevie Wonder, Obama, Michelle, Al Sharpton. Not much diversity there, if you asked me. Yeah, it is. It is funny. So on the weekend, she threw herself a birthday party with celebrities and he went to a football game and worked the fryer. That's a problem for her. She looks at a touch and who throws herself a birthday party? I would definitely would never do something like that. When you reach a certain age, you just try to stop acknowledging how old you are. Exactly. That's what I do. Women are different. Women like to celebrate birthday months. I don't speak for women. Oh, really? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? I was talking to Barack and said, she's not as strong as I was and Barack agreed. And so now Barack owns this. And he's now guilty because he staged this coup and it might not work out. That would be twice he screwed Biden over and endorsed a woman who Trump likely beat two of them. And so now he has to go out and campaign his butt off. He doesn't want that. He wants to be in Hawaii. Now he's on the campaign trail with Bill Clinton, someone who doesn't really represent the quorum, I might add. And now Liz Cheney's out there and Stevie Wonder. It's like the broken status quo that Trump's always run against and always done well against. Now the decorum thing's interesting because they found crack in her White House and they had a transflasher and the president sniffs women's hair. Who cares about the quorum? This country's sinking. It's like she's complaining Trump didn't put a napkin in his lap during the Titanic. Who cares? We had a guy that was supposed to be this Gentile elder statesman that was going to bring decorum back to the White House and look where that got us. This country regrets Joe Biden. This is like our guilty conscience. Basically when they elect Trump, it's going to be like, you know what, we made a mistake. My bad. Mm. Last word to you, Richard. Oh, I mean, I don't know if Trump did all of the elections. Didn't he lose in 2020? He did. Okay, just checking. I just want to make sure he lost. He did. He did lose. He did that to like leave the White House and everything. So he lost. Yeah, he did. Okay, just checking. All right. I'm glad you acknowledged that. All right. So a couple of things here. There's just so much. But one, I, where I agree with Dana is she is trying to earn everybody's vote. Today alone, she's going to be in three states. She was in Pennsylvania. She's in Michigan. She's in Wisconsin. Four states if you count in the creation. Ha, ha, funny. Over the weekend, she didn't throw herself a birthday party. She actually went to a number of souls to the polls, church visits. And at one of those church visits, they sang her happy birthday. That's a little bit different than somebody throwing themselves a birthday party. But she was campaigning on her birthday, which tells you how much even in the breakfast every talk, she's going to work for every single vote. She's going to talk to every single voter. And she's going after disinfected Republican, just as much as she's going after African America, she's going after Latino voters because she wants everybody to be part of their administration. And I think to say that, you know, the Biden, like the Biden team and the Biden White House is not part of this, I think that's also a misnomer because we saw the White House do today was something that we haven't seen in a long time. They're actually, like, I know you don't speak for women, but the White House seems to care about American women. They pass one of the, they pass one of the largest expansions in healthcare today, or a rule that will allow for women to get reproductive care and birth control over the counter paid for by their health insurance. It's the biggest expense we've seen in healthcare and decades, done by the Biden White House today, which will help American women who have private health insurance. And it makes their, oh, make their paycheck go a little bit further and a little bit better. And that's the thing that most women will be happy about. And I think this is something that shows that you have, there's a clear contrast between these two campaigns. One campaign will make it harder for women to get reproductive health. Another campaign will make sure that women do get through the better health they need. And I think that's what the contrast of these campaigns are. I think it is. No, I think it is a contrast. I think Republicans see women as an entire human being. Democrats. Democrats just see you as a womb that needs to be stopped. No. Well, I think that's the Republicans when they take the role, they're right to have reproductive care. So, you know what, the whole idea of souls to the polls for someone who's in support of third-term abortions are into transgender, I mean, give me a break. No, no, no, no, souls of the people, something created by pastors, I was a kid. For someone who's doing souls to the polls because- And hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on a second, Judge, let's just correct the record here. Why I'm correct if you're a record? No, no, no, no, let's just be talking, when the Voting Rights Act was passed in the 1960s, it was passed because churches, a lot of churches and a lot of pastors were behind passing. That's where souls of the polls came from and what happened in many places is the weekend, it happens to- I think the pastors are in support of the third-term abation or abortion. It was the babies born and born alive. Excuse me, it was pastors that invited vice president Kamala Harris to their church over the weekend. Yeah. Thank you. All right, let's go, kids.

It's all about platitudes and word salads that we've been dealt with over the last three years, three and a half years. But in Trump's running circles around her, but I got to make one more comment. It's Lizzo. If you ever need a proof of someone being more out of touch with Americans, when she says, yeah, we're going to make America like Detroit. You know, and it'll be, it'll be, it'll be terrific. I mean, unless she's talking about making Detroit great again as in a manga, making America great again, nobody's interested in Detroit the way it is. I mean, 33, 34% of the people are below the poverty line. They don't have jobs, the crime is through the room. You know, I got to disagree with the judge, Dana. Celebrities do matter to me. If it's Philip Michael Thomas, who played tubs in Miami Vice, tells me who vote for. I'm there with you, Philip Michael Thomas. What do you think about? You think that celebrities can replace policy? Nope. No. No. Never has. And I'm not swayed by it. And I obviously other people haven't been either. One thing I'll say about Kamala Harris, throughout this campaign, she doesn't play the woman card or the race card. She always says, I want to earn this on the merits. And that's refreshing because that's not what 2016 was like at all. The other thing, I was going to make the Detroit point, but I won't do that now. The other thing is I feel like this idea that she doesn't want to campaign with Biden, that was going to be an inevitable storyline. But Biden should help her do this. So when he finally said, okay, I'm going to give this speech, even if it was under duress, he was making a decision that she was going to be the heir apparent. So what he should have done, knowing that this storyline was coming is to say, it's okay. I know you are loyal to me. And it is okay if you disinjusted yourself from me. There's three possible items where you could say something that will maybe look like it hurts my feelings, but in the long run, if it helps you win, that will be better for me. And so I think that that burden kind of goes back to the Biden White House and they haven't been trying to help her at all. Last thing I would say is she's doing a lot of things, but do not confuse movement with progress. Because it feels like right now after the convention, she was on this glide path to victory. But Donald Trump's been gaining. And it's like, well, who's going to get to election day at the top? That's like an algebra problem. It really is. I will take a disagree with you. I do think that she does play the race card, which he changes her accents. Isn't she playing the race card? Lots of races. And a lot of her issues are race based. The plan for black men just took this stuff that didn't work. Yeah, but she's not saying vote for me because I'm black. Really? Really? Well, let me ignore that comment. Go to Jesse. Yeah. Lizzo Usher, Stevie Wonder, Obama, Michelle, Al Sharpton. Not much diversity there, if you asked me. Yeah, it is. It is funny. So on the weekend, she threw herself a birthday party with celebrities and he went to a football game and worked the fryer. That's a problem for her. She looks at a touch and who throws herself a birthday party? I would definitely would never do something like that. When you reach a certain age, you just try to stop acknowledging how old you are. Exactly. That's what I do. Women are different. Women like to celebrate birthday months. I don't speak for women. Oh, really? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? Do you? I was talking to Barack and said, she's not as strong as I was and Barack agreed. And so now Barack owns this. And he's now guilty because he staged this coup and it might not work out. That would be twice he screwed Biden over and endorsed a woman who Trump likely beat two of them. And so now he has to go out and campaign his butt off. He doesn't want that. He wants to be in Hawaii. Now he's on the campaign trail with Bill Clinton, someone who doesn't really represent the quorum, I might add. And now Liz Cheney's out there and Stevie Wonder. It's like the broken status quo that Trump's always run against and always done well against. Now the decorum thing's interesting because they found crack in her White House and they had a transflasher and the president sniffs women's hair. Who cares about the quorum? This country's sinking. It's like she's complaining Trump didn't put a napkin in his lap during the Titanic. Who cares? We had a guy that was supposed to be this Gentile elder statesman that was going to bring decorum back to the White House and look where that got us. This country regrets Joe Biden. This is like our guilty conscience. Basically when they elect Trump, it's going to be like, you know what, we made a mistake. My bad. Mm. Last word to you, Richard. Oh, I mean, I don't know if Trump did all of the elections. Didn't he lose in 2020? He did. Okay, just checking. I just want to make sure he lost. He did. He did lose. He did that to like leave the White House and everything. So he lost. Yeah, he did. Okay, just checking. All right. I'm glad you acknowledged that. All right. So a couple of things here. There's just so much. But one, I, where I agree with Dana is she is trying to earn everybody's vote. Today alone, she's going to be in three states. She was in Pennsylvania. She's in Michigan. She's in Wisconsin. Four states if you count in the creation. Ha, ha, funny. Over the weekend, she didn't throw herself a birthday party. She actually went to a number of souls to the polls, church visits. And at one of those church visits, they sang her happy birthday. That's a little bit different than somebody throwing themselves a birthday party. But she was campaigning on her birthday, which tells you how much even in the breakfast every talk, she's going to work for every single vote. She's going to talk to every single voter. And she's going after disinfected Republican, just as much as she's going after African America, she's going after Latino voters because she wants everybody to be part of their administration. And I think to say that, you know, the Biden, like the Biden team and the Biden White House is not part of this, I think that's also a misnomer because we saw the White House do today was something that we haven't seen in a long time. They're actually, like, I know you don't speak for women, but the White House seems to care about American women. They pass one of the, they pass one of the largest expansions in healthcare today, or a rule that will allow for women to get reproductive care and birth control over the counter paid for by their health insurance. It's the biggest expense we've seen in healthcare and decades, done by the Biden White House today, which will help American women who have private health insurance. And it makes their, oh, make their paycheck go a little bit further and a little bit better. And that's the thing that most women will be happy about. And I think this is something that shows that you have, there's a clear contrast between these two campaigns. One campaign will make it harder for women to get reproductive health. Another campaign will make sure that women do get through the better health they need. And I think that's what the contrast of these campaigns are. I think it is. No, I think it is a contrast. I think Republicans see women as an entire human being. Democrats. Democrats just see you as a womb that needs to be stopped. No. Well, I think that's the Republicans when they take the role, they're right to have reproductive care. So, you know what, the whole idea of souls to the polls for someone who's in support of third-term abortions are into transgender, I mean, give me a break. No, no, no, no, souls of the people, something created by pastors, I was a kid. For someone who's doing souls to the polls because- And hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on a second, Judge, let's just correct the record here. Why I'm correct if you're a record? No, no, no, no, let's just be talking, when the Voting Rights Act was passed in the 1960s, it was passed because churches, a lot of churches and a lot of pastors were behind passing. That's where souls of the polls came from and what happened in many places is the weekend, it happens to- I think the pastors are in support of the third-term abation or abortion. It was the babies born and born alive. Excuse me, it was pastors that invited vice president Kamala Harris to their church over the weekend. Yeah. Thank you. All right, let's go, kids. I had weirdo Tim Waltz, a spin-in lies about Donald Trump while trying to replay his glory days as an assistant coach.

Judge Jeanine: Nobody cares what leftist Hollywood elites think,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axzMVHUyFSM,2024-10-22 00:15:01+00:00,Kamala Harris blowout victory?,0.6211714744567871," 15 days to go and Kamala momentum is in the toilet. VP Harris looking to Hollywood a rescuer stalled out campaign. Over the weekend, she was rolling out the star power with Lizzo. That's her on the left. Usher and Stevie Wonder. And later this week, she got the Democratic Dream team of Barry and Michelle. Oh, but there's one big name missing in this coconut party. The Harris campaign is said to be abandoning Joe Biden in the final weeks before election day with no current plans for Kamala to campaign with the big guy. But she is hitting up Al Sharpton to whine about Trump. A role model of what it means to be committed to certain standards, including international rules and norms, but also standards of decorum. And what you see in my opponent, a former president of the United States, really is, it means the office. Do you think some of the resistance of some men, Black and White, is misogynist? I have the support of countless Black men who are in elected positions. I am very clear. I must earn, earn the vote of everyone, regardless of their race or gender. So Joe Sharpton is a staunch defender of decorum and misogyny. I would call them the rose of parks of hate crime hoaxes. You can forget his dedicated defense of Tawana Brawley in 1987, which launched a whole litany all the way up to Justice Smollett. So in a sense, he really is a forerunner. You are so right, Greg. I must tell you, your knowledge of history, as it relates to Al Sharpton, is really incredible. A parallel. Yes, it is unparalleled. You know, let me just tell you something. I mean, Kamala Harris, it's kind of interesting to hear her say she's been clear that she wants to earn everybody's vote. I mean, she ought to go out there and really try to earn it as opposed to, you know, just reading scripted speeches at rallies. But more than that, I mean, calling on the Hollywood elite, calling on Bill Clinton. He didn't do her any favors. He basically said, like, and Riley wouldn't be dead if there was any vetting. That's no good. And Obama didn't do her any help because Obama's the one who was talking down to Black men saying, you know, you got to vote for this woman, you know, in lecturing them about voting for a woman, a Black woman for president. I made such crap. Plus, celebrities, no one listens to celebrities anymore. Nobody cares about what they think. Everybody knows that the Hollywood elite are leftist. And, you know, being a celebrity is nothing more than a distraction. The voters want to know who Kamala Harris is. And they don't know it yet because she won't let them know that.

That's where souls of the polls came from and what happened in many places is the weekend, it happens to- I think the pastors are in support of the third-term abation or abortion. It was the babies born and born alive. Excuse me, it was pastors that invited vice president Kamala Harris to their church over the weekend. Yeah. Thank you. All right, let's go, kids. I had weirdo Tim Waltz, a spin-in lies about Donald Trump while trying to replay his glory days as an assistant coach.

This intel leak could be an 'act of treason': Rep. Mast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeEKvjZeMAI,2024-10-21 18:15:00+00:00,Israel military response against Iran in October?,0.6136583089828491," It's a new guy, it's a new guy. It's a new guy. It's a new guy. Israel launching airstrikes on Hezbollah financial operations in Beirut, Lebanon. They are trying to destroy those terrorist banking system. It comes as the United States is now investigating a leak of highly classified intelligence about the moves that Israel was planning for retaliation against Iran. They have every right to do it. How did the leak happen? How Speaker Mike Johnson? The leak is very concerning. There's some serious allegations being made. I think that the United States needs to stand unequivocally by our ally there right now. There is really, we're on a precipice, I think, Jake, of a new era of security and freedom for Israel. And I think we're very close. I hope I pray to end in that conflict there. But we cannot equivocate. We can't appease Iran. Now is the time for a maximum pressure campaign against the head of the snake. Let's go to Trey Yiggs in Israel, Trey. Your hair is good morning. Overnight Israel launched a series of airstrikes against banks linked to Hezbollah. Smoke could be seen rising from the Beirut skyline as explosions. Rock the Hezbollah stronghold of Dakhia and at least one location near the airport. In addition to the Lebanese capital, the Bekah Valley also saw new strikes. After a senior Israeli intelligence official briefed the media about efforts to weaken Hezbollah's ability to finance its war against Israel. On the ground, Israel is continuing to push deeper into Lebanon with new soldiers entering each day. Hezbollah also continuing its attacks into northern Israel, firing hundreds of rockets over the border this weekend. With the northern front Romanian active, the U.S. Special Envoy almost huckstained, Is in Beirut today for meetings about a path forward to end the war. Israel reportedly gave the U.S. a document last week with its demands for a ceasefire. Among the demands is that Israel wants to maintain an ability to conduct raids into Lebanon, and what's being referred to as active enforcement of an agreement. Israel's southern front also remains active with new evacuation of Palestinian civilians taking place. An active ground fighting between Israel and Hamas on going this weekend, three Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza, including an Israeli colonel who served as the commander of the 401st Brigade. Colonel Esan Daksa is the highest ranking Israeli officer killed on the ground in Gaza since the war began. Now, with all eyes on the southern and northern front, there is a major question today about how the Israelis are going to respond to Iran following that ballistic missile attack earlier this month. Harris. Trey, thank you. The free press is asking, is the leak by U.S. intelligence meant to sabotage Israel? They say the latest leak could cause Netanyahu's government to decide to share, even less of its military planning, a major step given the implications for the U.S. of any Israeli attack on Iran. Republican Congressman Brian Mass from Florida is with me now, and he also volunteered for the Israeli defense forces, and served our military as well. Thank you for all of your service. First of all, what do you make of this leak? Can you get to the bottom of it on the hill? I can't sit here and tell you right now, this is a name that I can identify, this is directly where it came from, but I can tell you things peripheral to this that tells us there are unfortunately some leaky ships out there. We know that we had in the past, Robert Malley, chief envoy to Iran, lost his security clearance. I know for a fact, as we speak, there is a senior DOD advisor that was working for an Iranian influence campaign that was working on behalf of Iran to successfully influence American diplomats working in the DOD as we speak. We know that you had people in Onro that were working for Hamas. We have people in Unifil, which is the group for United Nations that's in Lebanon that have been working with Hezbollah. So there are a lot of leaks in these ships and it's hard to say exactly where it's coming from, but we know that it's coming from. So look, given the implications, and I'll ask you about what those are, but the United States strongest ally in that region is Israel. So anything that hurts Israel, just like Biden has been saying about Ukraine, hurts the United States. That's an act of treason if they worked against us and leaked this material. You said it accurately, literally an act of treason. Where does that come from and how does it affect us? Israel, as you said, I can't add more to it. They are our greatest aircraft carrier in the region. The best place for any operations to support the United States of America in that region come from Israel, whether it's against Iranian proxies like Hezbollah or whether it's against any of our enemies there. And the intelligence that we need, the cross training that we need, that's our best aircraft carrier. You look at what they're looking at doing right now with Iran and the potential for targets that they might hit. There's great benefit for America there. If they start hitting Iranian oil in response, well, look at what that does to China, who's right now getting, let's say, three, four, five million barrels of oil a day from Iran, getting money to Iran from China. That's a big way to put China on their heels if Israel attacks them. That's one example of how we're affected in that connection. Wow, that's a lot of great detail for us to dig into. Look, whoever takes over in after November 5th, it's going to be important that they have the experience and the acumen to deal with people all over the world on these issues. It's going to be important that maybe they didn't get us into new situations or end Afghanistan badly. So that would be the left side of the ticket I'm pointing at here in terms of where the weaknesses are. But look, let's go to the source, Vice Presidential candidate or presidential candidate, VP Kamala Harris, was pressed this weekend on the recent escalation in the Israel Hamas war and her words. It's going to be difficult, but we have got to get this war over with. We got to get the hostages out. We need the word to end. The number of innocent Palestinians that have been killed in Gaza, it's really unconscionable. And we have to be honest about that. Any ideas there from how she would handle this situation that is really impending and might still be going on on November 6th the day after. We know from her own words that she wouldn't do anything differently than what Joe Biden has done. But where can we juxtapose that to Donald Trump? Donald Trump, we know his yes is yes, his no is no. What he says he will do, he will in fact do. We know that he has a tremendous backing for Israel, everything that he did in his first administration with recognizing the goal on heights, the embassy in Israel, the capital of Israel. He has Israel's back in a way that you just don't see coming out of this administration. And even in this very moment, you see, in my opinion, Joe Biden not willing to stand on the stage alongside Kamala Harris. I think he doesn't want Kamala Harris dragging down his approval rating. Well, Congressman Mast always great to have you in focus. Thank you for your time and your expertise.

Kayleigh McEnany: This could cost Kamala Harris a possible win,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4i17fjvXU0,2024-10-21 16:45:00+00:00,Will George W. Bush endorse Kamala Harris?,0.6158156394958496," Here's your blue wall blitz, Ms. Perino, right? Bob. Mm-hmm. If she takes a blue wall and that one electrode of oat and Nebraska, she'll get to 27. That's why she's doing it. Milwaukee today, areas of Detroit today, and also Philadelphia in the southeast corner today, all for Kamala Harris. Put all the poles together right now. Super close. This is, you know, Pennsylvania trumps up point eight percentage points, right? Michigan trumps up about 1.2 percentage points. Wisconsin. It's less than one point between the two. Really, really close. Historically, this is something else, right? What was the old commercial, asked Mikey because he likes it, all that stuff, right? Remember that? Okay, this is Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Going back to 1992, all three stays voted for the same candidate, all three, and only one time was it a Republican, and that was Trump in 2016. Now you understand how the blue wall, I took that sucker in there. How the blue wall got to become the blue wall, right? Here it is. This is Michigan in 2020, Biden less than three points. Super close and Michigan. This is PA in 2020, right? Biden 1.2 points. I mean, Michigan's looking like a blowout right now. And this is Wisconsin from 2020. Point six points for Biden. Again, all three, three for three, going back to 1992, the vote is a block. Let's swing on over here, and we'll bring in our next guest to give us our best analysis coming our way. I love having Kayleigh McAnony on a Monday. She's a co-host about numbered, and maybe we'll talk to make you permanent Monday status here, because you helped us kick off the week. We know that Harris has no current plans to campaign with Biden, but I think that makes sense. It makes total sense. CNN said that one of her most popular moments in the debate, according to internal polling, was when she said clearly, I am not Joe Biden. We've all seen the data. We also all NBC last week, where 25% say Biden's policies have helped them. 44% said that about Trump. The data is clear. You must separate yourself, but she's apparently very loyal. That's what they've been backrounding to reporters. The thing is, your loyalty might cause you a cross-country trip back to California, a move back in January, if you keep that loyal. Speaking of California, here's the governor, Gavin Newsom about how you can't do it. She tried to tell Peter Alexander this on Friday when she was in Michigan, because she had that comment about, you know, even my pants was loyal to Donald Trump. It's hard to get a separation between the two. Here's Newsom making a point in a different way now. She sees the world with her own set of eyes, her own unique experience, her own journey by definition. She's a change candidate. She's a generational candidate in that respect. She's also the vice president of the United States, and I think it's an almost impossible position to be in. If she separates too much, it becomes then the new narrative, where we zig and zag to that narrative, and not what she wants to focus on. I think a lot of what he says is right. Yes. Do you think she's going to zig and zag successfully this? He has a point. And look, I thought her answer to Peter Alexander was her best answer yet on the topic. It is right. She said it's not helpful to the relationship between a president and vice president to have this separation. And then she went on to say, I'd prioritize housing and Medicare in a different way. That's a really good answer. But why don't you do that the first time in the second time? Why is it taking this long to get to that answer, which I think is the honest one? And I also think that in a way, this, if I may say, the burden is not necessarily hers. So Biden, when he said, this is my decision, even if it wasn't, and I'm going to do this, and he should have given her permission to say, you can distance from me. I'm not, my feelings are not going to be hurt. I know you're a loyal person, but that didn't happen. Speaking of the switcheroo, apparently Nancy Pelosi is not happy. There's a new book by Jonathan Alter called American Reckoning. And she says she's not happy that the only bloody fingerprints on the knife were hers when it came to getting Biden out, and that Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and other Democratic leadership were in on it, but they didn't take any of the hits. That's 100% correct. So when you go back and look at how this saga played out, there was a July 5th comment by Nancy Pelosi saying it's a legitimate question to ask whether Biden had an episode or a condition. Then you go to July 10th, and she's out on Morning Joe, and she has that famous comment where she says, we're all waiting on Biden to make his decision after he had already made his decision to stay in the race. Jake Sherman says that was like a bomb that went off and gave permission for Democrats to distance themselves from Biden. Then shift comes out, and all of this happens. And it isn't until July 18th that we get one signal that Obama's not on board via a story in the Washington Post that popped during the RNC. It was Nancy Pelosi leading the way. And she has a point where was Obama and Schumer. They were very late to the game. It's not a phrase. No, she's not. She's a queen maker. I always thought that Obama waited a week because he didn't want to have his fingerprints on the gun. I thought that was his strategy. Well, also, they might have won it. I think also they thought that perhaps having a mini primary was better than the situation they have now. I think at the time many of them did feel that way. I think this is still the best political story that you have to be written. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. And interestingly, that book says if they would not have floated the idea of a mini primary, a lot of Dems wouldn't have gotten on board if they would have known it was common. So a lot of interesting drama. Yeah, we'll see it now. Early in-person voting is on in a big way in Georgia and now North Carolina. And a lot of folks are voting. So we're going to read the T-Leaves by the day. See it now. Great to have you. Thank you. I'm Steve Ducy. I'm Brian Killme. And I'm meansly Earhart.

Kayleigh McEnany: This could cost Kamala Harris a possible win,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4i17fjvXU0,2024-10-21 16:45:00+00:00,Kamala Harris fires campaign manager?,0.6088642477989197," Here's your blue wall blitz, Ms. Perino, right? Bob. Mm-hmm. If she takes a blue wall and that one electrode of oat and Nebraska, she'll get to 27. That's why she's doing it. Milwaukee today, areas of Detroit today, and also Philadelphia in the southeast corner today, all for Kamala Harris. Put all the poles together right now. Super close. This is, you know, Pennsylvania trumps up point eight percentage points, right? Michigan trumps up about 1.2 percentage points. Wisconsin. It's less than one point between the two. Really, really close. Historically, this is something else, right? What was the old commercial, asked Mikey because he likes it, all that stuff, right? Remember that? Okay, this is Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Going back to 1992, all three stays voted for the same candidate, all three, and only one time was it a Republican, and that was Trump in 2016. Now you understand how the blue wall, I took that sucker in there. How the blue wall got to become the blue wall, right? Here it is. This is Michigan in 2020, Biden less than three points. Super close and Michigan. This is PA in 2020, right? Biden 1.2 points. I mean, Michigan's looking like a blowout right now. And this is Wisconsin from 2020. Point six points for Biden. Again, all three, three for three, going back to 1992, the vote is a block. Let's swing on over here, and we'll bring in our next guest to give us our best analysis coming our way. I love having Kayleigh McAnony on a Monday. She's a co-host about numbered, and maybe we'll talk to make you permanent Monday status here, because you helped us kick off the week.

Ex-HUD Secretary flags telling observation about Kamala Harris,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arfydfR3T28,2024-10-20 22:30:00+00:00,Trump gets more black voters than in 2020?,0.6375472545623779," In a new poll from the New York Times, 20 percent of black men say they are voting for former President Trump. 70 percent said that they are backing Vice President Kamala Harris, which is down from 85 percent who supported President Biden in 2020. Do you want to be now with Reaction? It is the former HUD Secretary, Dr. Ben Carson, and former Georgia Senate candidate and College Football Hall of Famer, Hershel Walker. Gentlemen, thanks very much for being here. I've got to get your reaction to Obama, Dr. Carson. Well, Maria, thanks for having us. I always appreciate your courageous and logical approach. You know, Obama is basically falling back on the race and identity politics and saying, you know, she's black and you're black, therefore you should be voting for her. But I think there are a lot of people who are starting to analyze things in a more complex fashion. And they're looking at their lives under the Trump administration, which was not that long ago, so you don't have to look very far back and see that economically you were much better off. We had highest black home ownership, lowest unemployment, highest take home wages. You know, the list goes on and on in terms of the positives that were there. And I think some people are starting to look at that. And you know, I understand the herd mentality. You know, I grew up in Detroit and embossed them and went to school in New Haven and Arbor, that practice in Baltimore, all very liberal places. And so I know that herd mentality and that you're not supposed to move away from that herd mentality without being accused of all kinds of ridiculous things. But the fact of the matter is people are starting to make that move. They're starting to be courageous. They're starting to think for themselves. And that's why you're seeing the migration away. I think you'll see it even further. And you know, I used to think that way too. And then I did something that you're not supposed to do as a Democrat. I listened to a Republican and that was Ronald Wigan. And I said, he sounds just like my mother. You know, no excuses, personal responsibility, hard work. And those are the things that really led to success in our society. Hershiel, how do you see it? It was totally insulting. It was very insulting. And I want to say hello to Dr. Carson because he's a pioneer. But at the same time, I want to say, you know, this happens every election year. People of color becomes important. And then they start offering you everything. But yet you see where you're at when the election is over. They forget about you. They forget about you. And I want to say right now, you know, I've known President Trump since 84. And you know, what he says he does. You remember opportunities, zones. You remember that he was trying to do things with historic and black colleges. So he was thinking about sustainability. And that's something that Kamala Harris is not even thinking about. We want sustainability. It's not for you to give us trinkets. They just want to give you trinkets just for you to get a vote. And that's the problem that we have. And that's what I want everyone out there to know. Whether you of color is that people of color want the same as everyone else. They want their energy prices to be down. They want the food prices to be down. They don't want you to give them trinkets. They want you to give them sustainability. And that's what President Obama then talked about. He just talked about schooling you. He's upset because you can think for yourself. And think you, Dr. Carson, for saying that you saw a Republican and you saw it at Waitermann. She sounds just like my parents. They want me to have an education. They want me to go out and do something that, get a job. Did they talk about giving a person a color of a job? Did they talk about giving him education? No. Well, it's a great point because speaking of trinkets, Dr. Carson Kamala did come out with what she's calling a plan for black men. She said she's going to give you up to $20,000 in a forgivable loan. So here's up to $20,000. Make sure you vote for me. And then she said that she was going to make it legal for black men to start marijuana businesses. I mean, these were her plans. You don't really hear detail on it because she doesn't come out and do press conferences or speak to the people. She wouldn't even take responsibility for the border in Brett Barr's fantastic interview with her last week. I think it's very informative just to watch her. And you understand why they have tried to hide her in the beginning. That was the plan. Now it's kind of too late to come out with her plans, but her plans don't make any sense. And they're identity-based and not based on any factual things. And the fact of the matter is, even though she's moved away from a lot of her very radical positions, at least she wants you to think she has. But when she said my values haven't changed, that was her signal to the left that you don't have to worry. I will say what I need to say to get elected, but I'm the same person. And you can believe that they understand that because if they didn't, they'd be riding and streets. Well, which is why I asked Dr. Bernie, which is why I asked Senator Bernie Sanders, rather part of me. If in fact he would be insulted or betrayed. If in fact she did now flip flop and keep the flip flop in terms of going forward with fracking. And I know her show you wanted to react to Bernie Sanders. Well, you know, first of all, I'm in the food industry and he is totally wrong. You know, we're not that gouging our prices. I'm just trying to make it. I've been in it for 25 years and I don't think you've ever ran a business. And Maria, I want you to know, you know, I was in Athens, Georgia when Lincoln Riley was, was, was killed. It devastated not only that family, but that campus. And in you know, they said that they don't like the term to intimate within. Well, they are the enemy within because when you let illegal coming to this country and kill an American citizen or you have illegal coming to this country, taking over apartment units, it not just, just a few of them. That is an intimate within and that's what that's letting happen right now. They're not addressing the border. They're not addressing this economy. They're not addressing things that affect American citizen and we people of color are matter of a citizen just like everyone else and we want the same as everyone else. And the people coming to this country is not right. Right now we want to secure border. We want to get this economy down and we have to work together to get that done. And right now, I don't think they left want to do that. They want to continue to point fingers. If you remember on Brett Baer, all she said was Trump, Trump, Trump. Well, I've known President Trump and he has not changed. He cares about this country. What President has ever been affected, like he's been affected. He's been a tempted assassination twice and he's still trying to fight for this country. Do either of you believe that Trump is racist, Dr. Carson? Not at all. I've been around him for the last ten years and all the people at Mar-a-Lago and at Trump towers, they love them. They've been there for a long time. You notice that the people with Kamala Harris don't stick with her very long. And that should tell you a lot about the person's character. Yeah, it's an important point. Gentlemen, great to have you this morning. I hope you'll come back soon, both. Thank you so much, Dr. Ben Carson, Herschel Walker. We will see you soon. Thank you, Maria. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News YouTube page and catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. You will not get it anywhere else."
"These Democrats are 'breaking up' with Kamala Harris and 'flirting' with Trump, GOP strategist says",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo6M636Had0,2024-10-20 03:00:24+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win the 2024 US Presidential Election?,0.710427463054657," meantime, the election countdown is on and a number of down ballot candidates appear to be dodging the vice president. Some vulnerable members of her party are even drawing connections with former president Trump in some new ads. Let's bring in Pete Seat. He is a GOP strategist, Pete. They say politics makes strange bedfellows, and that's happening in places like Pennsylvania where Bob Casey, the Democrat Senate candidate, is tying himself to Donald Trump? Yeah, Bob Casey is doing it in Pennsylvania, shared brown is doing it in Ohio, Tammy Baldwin is doing it in Wisconsin. Two of those, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, obviously critically important states to both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and getting to 270 electoral college votes. But what's so interesting to me about this is the issues that they're focused on in these ads. Bob Casey is talking about trade, Tammy Baldwin, about Made in America, shared brown, about immigration in the border. They could run ads on just the issues themselves, but instead they decide to invoke Donald Trump, use images of Donald Trump in these ads. They are breaking up with Kamala Harris and flirting with Donald Trump because their political prospects depend on it. So in a state like Pennsylvania where Trump seems to be edging out Kamala Harris, I don't know if you want to call it easily, but he seems to have the lead there. A guy like Bob Casey figures it's not going to hurt him to tie himself to Donald Trump? Well, if he's looking at internal polls that show that Donald Trump is starting to get a healthy lead in that state and Kamala Harris is starting to fall behind, yeah, he is going to put himself first and forget about Kamala Harris. Think back to June and July, right after the first presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, when a lot of Senate Democrat incumbents shared brown being won, John Tester and Montana being another started to distance themselves from Joe Biden. They did not want him to weigh down their chances at reelection. What happened? Joe Biden ended up dropping out of that race. Here we are now, a fortnight and a couple days away from election day and vulnerable Senate Democrats are starting to do the same with Kamala Harris. What is that portend for her campaign? Nothing good. Well, what about the co-tails of Kamala Harris? So I mean, you know, it would seem that a sitting vice president would have some. You would think so. But I think it's clear that Donald Trump has co-tails and Kamala Harris does not. Look, this has never been about Kamala Harris and she has been the Democratic Party nominee. This is all about Kamala Harris not being Joe Biden and not being Donald Trump. That is what her campaign is based on. That is the foundation of her effort. Watch the interview with Brett Baer just a couple of nights ago on this very network. She couldn't even talk about what her own policy stances were because she doesn't have any. She doesn't actually have a vision for the future. All she had was a tax and negativity towards the former president because that's her entire campaign is I'm not Donald Trump. So let's go back to Pennsylvania and I just find this fascinating because you know, an incumbent Democratic Senator from Pennsylvania is invoking and even using Donald Trump's image in his ads. What does that do for or maybe against David McCormick, the Republican candidate in that race? Well, Bob Casey is also doing this because he's fashioned him so much. He's himself as a moderate, as a centrist throughout his political career. But he has been in lockstep with the unabashedly liberal Biden Harris agenda. He in fact has voted with them not 80% of the time, not 90% of the time, but 98% of the time. Bob Casey has been with Biden Harris. So he needs to do something to pretend that he is a little closer to the middle and that something is putting Donald Trump in his ads, which look, he's now put a target on him. Donald Trump is going to take note the Trump campaign already has. They've been blasting out emails about these particular ads and you can bet that Trump is going to put his sites on Bob Casey and the others. He's going to backfire on them. The Senate is very much up for grabs, but Republicans are feeling that they have a pretty good chance to make, you know, well, to get the get control of the Senate. Are there other states in which Democrat candidates are tying themselves to Donald Trump? We're trying to. Yeah, so Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, as I said, shared Brown in Ohio, Alyssa Slotkin, who's a member of Congress, a House member right now in Michigan, is the Democrat nominee, she's doing it as well. And you know, the most dangerous thing a political prognosticator can do is get ahead of themselves. And in this case, that's getting ahead of polls, because the polls of today are not necessarily the results of tomorrow. Anything can happen, but this is something we need to pay attention to that Democrats are trying to tie themselves to Donald Trump. And keep in mind, too, this is not just about the majority in the Senate, which Republicans have a very, very high probability of capturing, but this could also determine which members win and end up in the caucus could determine who replaces Mitch McConnell as majority leader. You get more Republican senators to win. That's a larger voting pool of senators in the caucus and these folks who were not necessarily expected to win could be the decision makers in that race. All right, Pete Seat, Republican strategist. Pete, thanks very much."

Nothing good. Well, what about the co-tails of Kamala Harris? So I mean, you know, it would seem that a sitting vice president would have some. You would think so. But I think it's clear that Donald Trump has co-tails and Kamala Harris does not. Look, this has never been about Kamala Harris and she has been the Democratic Party nominee. This is all about Kamala Harris not being Joe Biden and not being Donald Trump. That is what her campaign is based on. That is the foundation of her effort. Watch the interview with Brett Baer just a couple of nights ago on this very network. She couldn't even talk about what her own policy stances were because she doesn't have any. She doesn't actually have a vision for the future. All she had was a tax and negativity towards the former president because that's her entire campaign is I'm not Donald Trump. So let's go back to Pennsylvania and I just find this fascinating because you know, an incumbent Democratic Senator from Pennsylvania is invoking and even using Donald Trump's image in his ads. What does that do for or maybe against David McCormick, the Republican candidate in that race? Well, Bob Casey is also doing this because he's fashioned him so much. He's himself as a moderate, as a centrist throughout his political career. But he has been in lockstep with the unabashedly liberal Biden Harris agenda. He in fact has voted with them not 80% of the time, not 90% of the time, but 98% of the time. Bob Casey has been with Biden Harris. So he needs to do something to pretend that he is a little closer to the middle and that something is putting Donald Trump in his ads, which look, he's now put a target on him. Donald Trump is going to take note the Trump campaign already has. They've been blasting out emails about these particular ads and you can bet that Trump is going to put his sites on Bob Casey and the others. He's going to backfire on them. The Senate is very much up for grabs, but Republicans are feeling that they have a pretty good chance to make, you know, well, to get the get control of the Senate. Are there other states in which Democrat candidates are tying themselves to Donald Trump? We're trying to. Yeah, so Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, as I said, shared Brown in Ohio, Alyssa Slotkin, who's a member of Congress, a House member right now in Michigan, is the Democrat nominee, she's doing it as well. And you know, the most dangerous thing a political prognosticator can do is get ahead of themselves. And in this case, that's getting ahead of polls, because the polls of today are not necessarily the results of tomorrow. Anything can happen, but this is something we need to pay attention to that Democrats are trying to tie themselves to Donald Trump. And keep in mind, too, this is not just about the majority in the Senate, which Republicans have a very, very high probability of capturing, but this could also determine which members win and end up in the caucus could determine who replaces Mitch McConnell as majority leader. You get more Republican senators to win. That's a larger voting pool of senators in the caucus and these folks who were not necessarily expected to win could be the decision makers in that race. All right, Pete Seat, Republican strategist. Pete, thanks very much."
"These Democrats are 'breaking up' with Kamala Harris and 'flirting' with Trump, GOP strategist says",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo6M636Had0,2024-10-20 03:00:24+00:00,Kamala Harris blowout victory?,0.6566910743713379," meantime, the election countdown is on and a number of down ballot candidates appear to be dodging the vice president. Some vulnerable members of her party are even drawing connections with former president Trump in some new ads. Let's bring in Pete Seat. He is a GOP strategist, Pete. They say politics makes strange bedfellows, and that's happening in places like Pennsylvania where Bob Casey, the Democrat Senate candidate, is tying himself to Donald Trump? Yeah, Bob Casey is doing it in Pennsylvania, shared brown is doing it in Ohio, Tammy Baldwin is doing it in Wisconsin. Two of those, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, obviously critically important states to both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and getting to 270 electoral college votes. But what's so interesting to me about this is the issues that they're focused on in these ads. Bob Casey is talking about trade, Tammy Baldwin, about Made in America, shared brown, about immigration in the border. They could run ads on just the issues themselves, but instead they decide to invoke Donald Trump, use images of Donald Trump in these ads. They are breaking up with Kamala Harris and flirting with Donald Trump because their political prospects depend on it. So in a state like Pennsylvania where Trump seems to be edging out Kamala Harris, I don't know if you want to call it easily, but he seems to have the lead there. A guy like Bob Casey figures it's not going to hurt him to tie himself to Donald Trump? Well, if he's looking at internal polls that show that Donald Trump is starting to get a healthy lead in that state and Kamala Harris is starting to fall behind, yeah, he is going to put himself first and forget about Kamala Harris. Think back to June and July, right after the first presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, when a lot of Senate Democrat incumbents shared brown being won, John Tester and Montana being another started to distance themselves from Joe Biden. They did not want him to weigh down their chances at reelection. What happened? Joe Biden ended up dropping out of that race. Here we are now, a fortnight and a couple days away from election day and vulnerable Senate Democrats are starting to do the same with Kamala Harris. What is that portend for her campaign?

Nothing good. Well, what about the co-tails of Kamala Harris? So I mean, you know, it would seem that a sitting vice president would have some. You would think so. But I think it's clear that Donald Trump has co-tails and Kamala Harris does not. Look, this has never been about Kamala Harris and she has been the Democratic Party nominee. This is all about Kamala Harris not being Joe Biden and not being Donald Trump. That is what her campaign is based on. That is the foundation of her effort. Watch the interview with Brett Baer just a couple of nights ago on this very network. She couldn't even talk about what her own policy stances were because she doesn't have any. She doesn't actually have a vision for the future. All she had was a tax and negativity towards the former president because that's her entire campaign is I'm not Donald Trump. So let's go back to Pennsylvania and I just find this fascinating because you know, an incumbent Democratic Senator from Pennsylvania is invoking and even using Donald Trump's image in his ads. What does that do for or maybe against David McCormick, the Republican candidate in that race? Well, Bob Casey is also doing this because he's fashioned him so much. He's himself as a moderate, as a centrist throughout his political career. But he has been in lockstep with the unabashedly liberal Biden Harris agenda. He in fact has voted with them not 80% of the time, not 90% of the time, but 98% of the time. Bob Casey has been with Biden Harris. So he needs to do something to pretend that he is a little closer to the middle and that something is putting Donald Trump in his ads, which look, he's now put a target on him. Donald Trump is going to take note the Trump campaign already has. They've been blasting out emails about these particular ads and you can bet that Trump is going to put his sites on Bob Casey and the others. He's going to backfire on them. The Senate is very much up for grabs, but Republicans are feeling that they have a pretty good chance to make, you know, well, to get the get control of the Senate. Are there other states in which Democrat candidates are tying themselves to Donald Trump? We're trying to. Yeah, so Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, as I said, shared Brown in Ohio, Alyssa Slotkin, who's a member of Congress, a House member right now in Michigan, is the Democrat nominee, she's doing it as well. And you know, the most dangerous thing a political prognosticator can do is get ahead of themselves. And in this case, that's getting ahead of polls, because the polls of today are not necessarily the results of tomorrow. Anything can happen, but this is something we need to pay attention to that Democrats are trying to tie themselves to Donald Trump. And keep in mind, too, this is not just about the majority in the Senate, which Republicans have a very, very high probability of capturing, but this could also determine which members win and end up in the caucus could determine who replaces Mitch McConnell as majority leader. You get more Republican senators to win. That's a larger voting pool of senators in the caucus and these folks who were not necessarily expected to win could be the decision makers in that race. All right, Pete Seat, Republican strategist. Pete, thanks very much."

Some vulnerable members of her party are even drawing connections with former president Trump in some new ads. Let's bring in Pete Seat. He is a GOP strategist, Pete. They say politics makes strange bedfellows, and that's happening in places like Pennsylvania where Bob Casey, the Democrat Senate candidate, is tying himself to Donald Trump? Yeah, Bob Casey is doing it in Pennsylvania, shared brown is doing it in Ohio, Tammy Baldwin is doing it in Wisconsin. Two of those, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, obviously critically important states to both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and getting to 270 electoral college votes. But what's so interesting to me about this is the issues that they're focused on in these ads. Bob Casey is talking about trade, Tammy Baldwin, about Made in America, shared brown, about immigration in the border. They could run ads on just the issues themselves, but instead they decide to invoke Donald Trump, use images of Donald Trump in these ads. They are breaking up with Kamala Harris and flirting with Donald Trump because their political prospects depend on it. So in a state like Pennsylvania where Trump seems to be edging out Kamala Harris, I don't know if you want to call it easily, but he seems to have the lead there. A guy like Bob Casey figures it's not going to hurt him to tie himself to Donald Trump? Well, if he's looking at internal polls that show that Donald Trump is starting to get a healthy lead in that state and Kamala Harris is starting to fall behind, yeah, he is going to put himself first and forget about Kamala Harris. Think back to June and July, right after the first presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, when a lot of Senate Democrat incumbents shared brown being won, John Tester and Montana being another started to distance themselves from Joe Biden. They did not want him to weigh down their chances at reelection. What happened? Joe Biden ended up dropping out of that race.

Nothing good. Well, what about the co-tails of Kamala Harris? So I mean, you know, it would seem that a sitting vice president would have some. You would think so. But I think it's clear that Donald Trump has co-tails and Kamala Harris does not. Look, this has never been about Kamala Harris and she has been the Democratic Party nominee. This is all about Kamala Harris not being Joe Biden and not being Donald Trump. That is what her campaign is based on. That is the foundation of her effort. Watch the interview with Brett Baer just a couple of nights ago on this very network. She couldn't even talk about what her own policy stances were because she doesn't have any. She doesn't actually have a vision for the future. All she had was a tax and negativity towards the former president because that's her entire campaign is I'm not Donald Trump. So let's go back to Pennsylvania and I just find this fascinating because you know, an incumbent Democratic Senator from Pennsylvania is invoking and even using Donald Trump's image in his ads. What does that do for or maybe against David McCormick, the Republican candidate in that race? Well, Bob Casey is also doing this because he's fashioned him so much. He's himself as a moderate, as a centrist throughout his political career. But he has been in lockstep with the unabashedly liberal Biden Harris agenda. He in fact has voted with them not 80% of the time, not 90% of the time, but 98% of the time. Bob Casey has been with Biden Harris. So he needs to do something to pretend that he is a little closer to the middle and that something is putting Donald Trump in his ads, which look, he's now put a target on him. Donald Trump is going to take note the Trump campaign already has. They've been blasting out emails about these particular ads and you can bet that Trump is going to put his sites on Bob Casey and the others. He's going to backfire on them. The Senate is very much up for grabs, but Republicans are feeling that they have a pretty good chance to make, you know, well, to get the get control of the Senate. Are there other states in which Democrat candidates are tying themselves to Donald Trump? We're trying to. Yeah, so Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, as I said, shared Brown in Ohio, Alyssa Slotkin, who's a member of Congress, a House member right now in Michigan, is the Democrat nominee, she's doing it as well. And you know, the most dangerous thing a political prognosticator can do is get ahead of themselves. And in this case, that's getting ahead of polls, because the polls of today are not necessarily the results of tomorrow. Anything can happen, but this is something we need to pay attention to that Democrats are trying to tie themselves to Donald Trump. And keep in mind, too, this is not just about the majority in the Senate, which Republicans have a very, very high probability of capturing, but this could also determine which members win and end up in the caucus could determine who replaces Mitch McConnell as majority leader. You get more Republican senators to win. That's a larger voting pool of senators in the caucus and these folks who were not necessarily expected to win could be the decision makers in that race. All right, Pete Seat, Republican strategist. Pete, thanks very much."
"These Democrats are 'breaking up' with Kamala Harris and 'flirting' with Trump, GOP strategist says",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo6M636Had0,2024-10-20 03:00:24+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win Massachusetts by the largest margin?,0.6090172529220581," meantime, the election countdown is on and a number of down ballot candidates appear to be dodging the vice president. Some vulnerable members of her party are even drawing connections with former president Trump in some new ads. Let's bring in Pete Seat. He is a GOP strategist, Pete. They say politics makes strange bedfellows, and that's happening in places like Pennsylvania where Bob Casey, the Democrat Senate candidate, is tying himself to Donald Trump? Yeah, Bob Casey is doing it in Pennsylvania, shared brown is doing it in Ohio, Tammy Baldwin is doing it in Wisconsin. Two of those, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, obviously critically important states to both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and getting to 270 electoral college votes. But what's so interesting to me about this is the issues that they're focused on in these ads. Bob Casey is talking about trade, Tammy Baldwin, about Made in America, shared brown, about immigration in the border. They could run ads on just the issues themselves, but instead they decide to invoke Donald Trump, use images of Donald Trump in these ads. They are breaking up with Kamala Harris and flirting with Donald Trump because their political prospects depend on it. So in a state like Pennsylvania where Trump seems to be edging out Kamala Harris, I don't know if you want to call it easily, but he seems to have the lead there. A guy like Bob Casey figures it's not going to hurt him to tie himself to Donald Trump? Well, if he's looking at internal polls that show that Donald Trump is starting to get a healthy lead in that state and Kamala Harris is starting to fall behind, yeah, he is going to put himself first and forget about Kamala Harris. Think back to June and July, right after the first presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, when a lot of Senate Democrat incumbents shared brown being won, John Tester and Montana being another started to distance themselves from Joe Biden. They did not want him to weigh down their chances at reelection. What happened? Joe Biden ended up dropping out of that race.

Israel PM Netanyahus private home targeted in drone attack: Report,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPBV_f--e30,2024-10-19 14:18:47+00:00,U.S. military strike on Lebanon before November?,0.6134811639785767," back with the Fox News alert, Israel striking Beirut just hours after an apparent assassination attempt on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The attempt on Netanyahu's life coming by way of a drone attack. Matt Finn joins us live from Tel Aviv this morning with more Matt. Good morning, Will. To the north of where I am right now in Tel Aviv, Israel says there was a drone strike launched at Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's vacation home. Israel says the drone was launched from Lebanon into Sicily. It did not hit Netanyahu's house. One Israeli official claims the drone strike was meant to eliminate Netanyahu. It was more than one of a hundred drones launched from Lebanon into northern Israel. Today our Fox crew has seen some of them. Netanyahu released a video a short while ago responding to Israel's monumental elimination this week of Hamas leader Yaya Sinwar. Two days ago we took out Yaya Sinwar, the terrorist mastermind whose goons beheaded our men, raped our women, burnt babies alive. We took him out and we're continuing our battle with Iran's other terrorist Foxies. We're going to win this war. Now check out this new drone video that shows the final moments of Sinwar's life this week. He's camouflaged amongst the rubble and the chair on the left. The last time he was considered the de facto leader of Hamas, perhaps enemy number one of Israel, the mastermind of October 7th. His death has sparked a speculation that perhaps Hamas will disarm. However, Hamas says Sinwar's death will not stop it. Writing in part, yes, it's very painful and distressing to lose beloved people, especially extraordinary, extraordinary leaders like ours. But what we are sure of is that we are eventually caught in the war. We've set the scene for you here in Israel. This was a holy week. You caught many people. We're not working not on their electronics meant to be meditating and praying. So you can only imagine that this monumental news of Sinwar's death was that much more welcome during an already somber week."
Kevin McCarthy: Democrats are preparing 'who to blame' for this loss,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcEs4AB4eU,2024-10-19 09:00:18+00:00,Kamala Harris wins the popular vote?,0.6115342378616333," The top line is the five point advantage that Kamala Harris had in our last poll is gone. I mean, just look at them side by side and you can see it. Democrats worry there could be a repeat of Donald Trump's 2016 win. Except bigger. Now reality has replaced vibes as the angle correctly predicted, Paul and Guru Nate Silver is now warning Democrats that Harris probably faces a tougher environment than Clinton or Biden. And incumbent parties around the world are struggling. Cultural pendulum swinging conservative inflation and immigration are big deals to voters, yeah, think. And now Silver is forecasting that Trump will win the election. This comes as the latest Fox News National poll has Trump ahead by two points. Joining me now, Kevin McCarthy, former speaker of the House, Mr. Speaker. Now she has raised a billion dollars. He's burned through most of that and they're going back to Wall Street and Silicon Valley for more money. They need more money they said to win in these swing states. What is going on here? They're yelling at their donors, they're yelling at the voters, why won't they support them? And the other thing you have to notice too, if you ever want to know which side is losing, look for the articles where there's infighting. You notice the Democrats now you get the article, there's all this infighting. Pennsylvania, campaign chief is a disaster. They're preparing who to blame, who to blame for this loss, who to blame, the party themselves, their policies for one, her as Kamala Harris. One thing historically is always told is she peaks on the day she announces and then she goes down from there, which we have watched happen. Secondly is there's a contrast here. They try to do the old thing against Donald Trump. You can't, the American public knows him. They know him now. They know him and they know his policies. So you can lie as much as you want, it doesn't play. The other thing too is something different. This environment, the one thing he's right, the environment is true. If you watch the Gallup poll a week and a half ago, it doesn't ask you who you're supporting, it asks you who you identify, Republican or Democrat. Historically, Republicans have never won. They won the poll by three points, 48, 45. You can look and you could correlate when Democrats win the presidency is the difference between those two. But Republicans have never won. They ask the second question, who's best to solve your problems? Republicans beat Democrats on that. Think about the voter registration to where it was four years ago. It grew with Republicans dropped with Democrats. So I don't know why the Democrats are missing. More Hispanics are voting for President Trump, 41. The highest black vote, the Republicans got a lot of time. But you're right, they're lashing out at black men. We're going to get to that coming up. Black men. Yellowing at them. Yeah, black men and then Hispanic voters are also saying, what are you doing here? What are you doing? And what are you doing here? You're doing for their own economic interest. Exactly. They've watched more of the same. When she said, look, if I ran President Trump's campaign, I won, run one ad between now the end. I'd use her own words, what would you have done different? I can't think of anything. Oh, she's a change candidate. She can't. Then just put more of the same. The only change is President Trump. Change back to where we don't have inflation. We have a secure border. We have a safe world with no more wars. We've got an America where everybody's rising. You know what people say to me a lot? Gosh, remember when interest rates were 2.1 percent, why didn't I buy a house or why didn't I buy an apartment or why did so many people's and they and you don't want people to think that'll never come again. That's over. You'll never have that dream of owning your own home again. And he's speaking to that now, which I think is very powerful. Oh, yeah. Economics is the biggest driver. And then next when you look at a secure border. But the thing about this, they attack his tax plan. You know what you remember on tax plan? All the headlines. People were getting raises. Their employer were giving them more money. She wants to take your money. Somebody else wants to make you have more money and we didn't have inflation. So when you got more money, it went further. So the celebrity factor is having zero. It never works. It never works. It never works. Katy Perry for Hillary Clinton, remember that and Bruce Brady. It works against you. It works against you. It's hard to touch celebrities. Can they not learn? They get excited by it but nobody else does. Mr. Speaker is always great to see you in studio. No less. Thank you so much. You're coming in. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News YouTube page and catch our hottest interviews. And most compelling analysis, you will not get it anywhere else."
Gutfeld: This was like watching Batman give a wedgie to the Penguin,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EYSGI6aB8,2024-10-19 03:15:02+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win the 2024 US Presidential Election?,0.6521110534667969," Trump's got the quips at the dinner. Comless skips are for any of the day comes to us from the Al Smith dinner, a fundraiser for Catholic charities here in New York. Historically, presidential candidates attend together, setting aside their differences for a good cause, and the chance to brutally roast each other, and Trump did not hold back. Roll it. Chuck Schumer is here looking very dumb. This day looks like a thumbnail. It looks like a thumbnail. But look on the bright side, Chuck, considering how woke your party has become, if Kamala loses, you still have a chance to become the first woman president. There's a group called White Dudes for Harris. Have you seen this? But I'm not worried about them at all, because their wives and their wives' lovers are all voting for me. The major issue in this race is childcare, and Kamala has put forward a concept of a plan. A lot of people don't like it. The only piece of advice I would have for her and the event that she wins would be not to let her husband dug anywhere near the nannies. Just keep them away. I used to think the Democrats were crazy for saying that men have periods, but then I met Tim Walsh. Well, I'd better wrap up because Mayor Adams told me earlier that I needed to make this one very quick, especially the city has reserved this room for a large group of illegal aliens coming in from Texas. But much like Jesse Water, when the bill comes, Kamala was a no-show. The first Democrat nominee to bail on the dinner since 84, and if you can't remember the candidate in 84, that's why. She chose to play at cringe-worthy pre-tapes kit. The House Smith Dinner provides a rare opportunity to set aside partisanship. Who was that? I'm sorry, Mary got the galley. Mary got the galley. It's an assentment. It is a very important dinner, and it's an important tradition that I'm so proud to be a part of. Sometimes when I get nervous, I stick my fingers under my arms and I swim all like that. I'm giving a speech. Do you have some thoughts about what I might say tonight? It's time for a warm man, bro. Don't forget to say superstar. Thank you, Mary Katherine. Thank you, Momela. Well, that was timely. Does anybody born after 1980 even know what the hell that was? But surprise, and the MC of the evening, Jim Caffkin, who also pleased him waltz on SNL, didn't let the dams off the hook. President Biden couldn't be here tonight. The DNC made sure of that. You know, this event has been referred to as the Catholic Met Gala. 22% of Americans identified as Catholic. Catholics will be a key demographic in every battleground state. I'm sorry. Why is Vice President Harris not here? The Democrats have been telling us Trump's re-election is a threat to democracy. In fact, they were so concerned of this threat, they staged a coup. Ousted, they're democratically elected, incumbent, and installed Kamala Harris. In other words, all her dreams have come true. Owls. It hurts more than my hemorrhoids. So, Bobby, you were there last night, and I wanted to ask you because we were talking about this earlier, this divisiveness, that this thick cloud of divisiveness, and yet you see Chuck Schumer playfully engaging Trump. And it kind of bothers me because it's like, publicly they say Trump is Satan, and then they're like, you know, shaking hands and having comfortable conversation. Schumer aware of the damage that his demonization is having when it's not true, especially when it's not true. I didn't see, from my perspective, I could not see Schumer enjoying any part of it. Yeah, okay. Or he did look plum throughout. Yeah. One of the really interesting phenomena about what's happened over really since COVID is that it used to be that comedy was the purview of the left. And that Republicans were kind of, at that time spouting kind of corporate and governmental orthodoxies. You can't be funny when you do that. And then all the funniest people on the left you can't not find Stephen Colbert who used to be one of the funniest people in the world. You can't watch him anymore. And all the comedy is now happening on the right. And even when I didn't like Trump, when I believed all of the propaganda against him, and you know, and saw a lot of the things about him that are, let's say, unconventional. But I always said he's got, he's the most entertaining politician that we've had in my lifetime. He has great comedic timing. And he showed that last. He was really funny last. I really drool. And yet he got, you know, it was all generally a hostile crowd. Yeah. And he got universal laughter on all of those jokes. And you don't see that on the left anymore. No, you don't. You know, Tyrus was a good idea for Kamla. You know what's funny is she did say in her video, it's important to come together. And then she didn't show up. Right. Well, again, this isn't like we haven't seen her in public settings. And I'm pretty sure when her team found out that there was no teleprompter, there was going to be no Kamla. Like, it's just, she doesn't do well in those settings. We haven't figured out what interview settings she does well in yet. But we're pretty sure. We're pretty sure getting up there in front of people and telling jokes. And here's the difference. Trump said some ones that weren't so great, right? Because he, unfortunately, he didn't have time to prep. Yeah. Because somebody made him late. It was, hi. But he went and did it anyway. And even when they were bad, I think one of the funniest parts of the whole thing was like, well, this one's terrible. Yeah. Oh, wow, I should have read this one through. He was not afraid to make fun of himself. Now, in the clips there, there was a lot of tough jokes. And the comedians were throwing real shots at him. But every time they did, he smiled, he acknowledged it, he laughed, he took it on, he was gracious. That would not have happened the other side. We would have saw what happened. We saw when she, who gets mad at Brett Bear? How hard is it? Like, no one gets mad at Brett Bear. And when she was screaming at Brett Bear, what was she going to do when he said that? We would have seen a reaction that would not have been good for us. So she thought not showing up was the best move, which should let everybody know exactly where their campaign is at right now. Joey Gaffigan talking about mentioning the coup. It's like, that seems like a right wing talking point, but he's not a right winger. He's a Democrat. No, I think he brought some personal animus in there. Like, hey, he is not happy about how that went out. That's how it came across to me. Because it was less comedy than some of the things that Trump was saying. And props to him for giving everyone that might tune in something that they could watch and not need to turn away from. I mean, I can't turn into, like, I don't get overly upset about what artists think or what celebrities want. I don't, that doesn't stop me from enjoying their art when they're good actors and singers. But I can't tune into the Golden Globes or the Oscars or anything like that. Because they're not telling me, Trump is bad. They're telling me I'm bad. Yes. He didn't do that last night. And I appreciate him for it. And for Trump, I think the biggest power move he did was slapping Schumer on the back and being, he's an alright guy. Because they are so focused on demonizing Trump. Like, that's all they have right now. I mean, when you look at the top issues for Kamala at Reddapol today going on newsroom, the second most important issue was that she isn't Trump. They've programmed people to believe he's just the absolute worst thing that could ever happen. He goes up there and says, yeah, yeah, this guy hates me, but he's alright. That's a power move. That's being an alpha. Yeah, you know, Dagen, it's like, when I saw him do that to Chuck, it was like watching Batman, you know, give a wedgie to the penguin. LAUGHTER Jerry Nadler wasn't there. That was so true. He looks more like the penguin than Nadler. Speaking of Nadler, it would be like reaching over and going, I've always wanted to do this with the dandruff. And his brush and brush and off is a suit coat. Because he kept going back to Chuck Schumer. Yeah. And at that point, he said, Chuck, he's the one who got Biden out. He's the guy, much more so than Nancy Pelosi. I know him. He's the one who did it. No more he talked about Chuck Schumer. Chuck Schumer became more and more like Montgomery Burns. Yeah. He was just, he was shrinking. He was like, please, please stop talking about me. Chuck was loose and confident. After a long day, he was every, I mean, he did it. We're going to show clips of Tyrus' interview later in the show. But like, I would be in bed by now. I don't get it. And before that, he was in Wall Street. Yeah. Like big meetings. He got it. Went to a barbershop in the Bronx. Sobsa kind of guy. I'll shut up. LAUGHTER No, they just yelled at me, I'll shut up. All right. Hey, Sean Hannity here.

Comless skips are for any of the day comes to us from the Al Smith dinner, a fundraiser for Catholic charities here in New York. Historically, presidential candidates attend together, setting aside their differences for a good cause, and the chance to brutally roast each other, and Trump did not hold back. Roll it. Chuck Schumer is here looking very dumb. This day looks like a thumbnail. It looks like a thumbnail. But look on the bright side, Chuck, considering how woke your party has become, if Kamala loses, you still have a chance to become the first woman president. There's a group called White Dudes for Harris. Have you seen this? But I'm not worried about them at all, because their wives and their wives' lovers are all voting for me. The major issue in this race is childcare, and Kamala has put forward a concept of a plan. A lot of people don't like it. The only piece of advice I would have for her and the event that she wins would be not to let her husband dug anywhere near the nannies. Just keep them away. I used to think the Democrats were crazy for saying that men have periods, but then I met Tim Walsh. Well, I'd better wrap up because Mayor Adams told me earlier that I needed to make this one very quick, especially the city has reserved this room for a large group of illegal aliens coming in from Texas. But much like Jesse Water, when the bill comes, Kamala was a no-show. The first Democrat nominee to bail on the dinner since 84, and if you can't remember the candidate in 84, that's why. She chose to play at cringe-worthy pre-tapes kit. The House Smith Dinner provides a rare opportunity to set aside partisanship. Who was that? I'm sorry, Mary got the galley. Mary got the galley. It's an assentment. It is a very important dinner, and it's an important tradition that I'm so proud to be a part of. Sometimes when I get nervous, I stick my fingers under my arms and I swim all like that. I'm giving a speech. Do you have some thoughts about what I might say tonight? It's time for a warm man, bro. Don't forget to say superstar. Thank you, Mary Katherine. Thank you, Momela. Well, that was timely. Does anybody born after 1980 even know what the hell that was? But surprise, and the MC of the evening, Jim Caffkin, who also pleased him waltz on SNL, didn't let the dams off the hook. President Biden couldn't be here tonight. The DNC made sure of that. You know, this event has been referred to as the Catholic Met Gala. 22% of Americans identified as Catholic. Catholics will be a key demographic in every battleground state. I'm sorry. Why is Vice President Harris not here? The Democrats have been telling us Trump's re-election is a threat to democracy. In fact, they were so concerned of this threat, they staged a coup. Ousted, they're democratically elected, incumbent, and installed Kamala Harris. In other words, all her dreams have come true. Owls. It hurts more than my hemorrhoids. So, Bobby, you were there last night, and I wanted to ask you because we were talking about this earlier, this divisiveness, that this thick cloud of divisiveness, and yet you see Chuck Schumer playfully engaging Trump. And it kind of bothers me because it's like, publicly they say Trump is Satan, and then they're like, you know, shaking hands and having comfortable conversation. Schumer aware of the damage that his demonization is having when it's not true, especially when it's not true. I didn't see, from my perspective, I could not see Schumer enjoying any part of it. Yeah, okay. Or he did look plum throughout. Yeah. One of the really interesting phenomena about what's happened over really since COVID is that it used to be that comedy was the purview of the left. And that Republicans were kind of, at that time spouting kind of corporate and governmental orthodoxies. You can't be funny when you do that. And then all the funniest people on the left you can't not find Stephen Colbert who used to be one of the funniest people in the world. You can't watch him anymore. And all the comedy is now happening on the right. And even when I didn't like Trump, when I believed all of the propaganda against him, and you know, and saw a lot of the things about him that are, let's say, unconventional. But I always said he's got, he's the most entertaining politician that we've had in my lifetime. He has great comedic timing. And he showed that last. He was really funny last. I really drool. And yet he got, you know, it was all generally a hostile crowd. Yeah. And he got universal laughter on all of those jokes. And you don't see that on the left anymore. No, you don't. You know, Tyrus was a good idea for Kamla. You know what's funny is she did say in her video, it's important to come together. And then she didn't show up. Right. Well, again, this isn't like we haven't seen her in public settings. And I'm pretty sure when her team found out that there was no teleprompter, there was going to be no Kamla. Like, it's just, she doesn't do well in those settings. We haven't figured out what interview settings she does well in yet. But we're pretty sure. We're pretty sure getting up there in front of people and telling jokes. And here's the difference. Trump said some ones that weren't so great, right? Because he, unfortunately, he didn't have time to prep. Yeah. Because somebody made him late. It was, hi. But he went and did it anyway.

We're going to show clips of Tyrus' interview later in the show. But like, I would be in bed by now. I don't get it. And before that, he was in Wall Street. Yeah. Like big meetings. He got it. Went to a barbershop in the Bronx. Sobsa kind of guy. I'll shut up. LAUGHTER No, they just yelled at me, I'll shut up. All right. Hey, Sean Hannity here.

Gutfeld: This was like watching Batman give a wedgie to the Penguin,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2EYSGI6aB8,2024-10-19 03:15:02+00:00,Kamala Harris wins the popular vote?,0.6051073670387268," Trump's got the quips at the dinner. Comless skips are for any of the day comes to us from the Al Smith dinner, a fundraiser for Catholic charities here in New York. Historically, presidential candidates attend together, setting aside their differences for a good cause, and the chance to brutally roast each other, and Trump did not hold back. Roll it. Chuck Schumer is here looking very dumb. This day looks like a thumbnail. It looks like a thumbnail. But look on the bright side, Chuck, considering how woke your party has become, if Kamala loses, you still have a chance to become the first woman president. There's a group called White Dudes for Harris. Have you seen this? But I'm not worried about them at all, because their wives and their wives' lovers are all voting for me. The major issue in this race is childcare, and Kamala has put forward a concept of a plan. A lot of people don't like it. The only piece of advice I would have for her and the event that she wins would be not to let her husband dug anywhere near the nannies. Just keep them away. I used to think the Democrats were crazy for saying that men have periods, but then I met Tim Walsh. Well, I'd better wrap up because Mayor Adams told me earlier that I needed to make this one very quick, especially the city has reserved this room for a large group of illegal aliens coming in from Texas. But much like Jesse Water, when the bill comes, Kamala was a no-show. The first Democrat nominee to bail on the dinner since 84, and if you can't remember the candidate in 84, that's why. She chose to play at cringe-worthy pre-tapes kit. The House Smith Dinner provides a rare opportunity to set aside partisanship. Who was that? I'm sorry, Mary got the galley. Mary got the galley. It's an assentment. It is a very important dinner, and it's an important tradition that I'm so proud to be a part of. Sometimes when I get nervous, I stick my fingers under my arms and I swim all like that. I'm giving a speech. Do you have some thoughts about what I might say tonight? It's time for a warm man, bro. Don't forget to say superstar. Thank you, Mary Katherine. Thank you, Momela. Well, that was timely. Does anybody born after 1980 even know what the hell that was? But surprise, and the MC of the evening, Jim Caffkin, who also pleased him waltz on SNL, didn't let the dams off the hook. President Biden couldn't be here tonight. The DNC made sure of that. You know, this event has been referred to as the Catholic Met Gala. 22% of Americans identified as Catholic. Catholics will be a key demographic in every battleground state. I'm sorry. Why is Vice President Harris not here? The Democrats have been telling us Trump's re-election is a threat to democracy. In fact, they were so concerned of this threat, they staged a coup. Ousted, they're democratically elected, incumbent, and installed Kamala Harris. In other words, all her dreams have come true. Owls. It hurts more than my hemorrhoids. So, Bobby, you were there last night, and I wanted to ask you because we were talking about this earlier, this divisiveness, that this thick cloud of divisiveness, and yet you see Chuck Schumer playfully engaging Trump. And it kind of bothers me because it's like, publicly they say Trump is Satan, and then they're like, you know, shaking hands and having comfortable conversation. Schumer aware of the damage that his demonization is having when it's not true, especially when it's not true. I didn't see, from my perspective, I could not see Schumer enjoying any part of it. Yeah, okay. Or he did look plum throughout. Yeah. One of the really interesting phenomena about what's happened over really since COVID is that it used to be that comedy was the purview of the left. And that Republicans were kind of, at that time spouting kind of corporate and governmental orthodoxies. You can't be funny when you do that. And then all the funniest people on the left you can't not find Stephen Colbert who used to be one of the funniest people in the world. You can't watch him anymore. And all the comedy is now happening on the right. And even when I didn't like Trump, when I believed all of the propaganda against him, and you know, and saw a lot of the things about him that are, let's say, unconventional. But I always said he's got, he's the most entertaining politician that we've had in my lifetime. He has great comedic timing. And he showed that last. He was really funny last. I really drool. And yet he got, you know, it was all generally a hostile crowd. Yeah. And he got universal laughter on all of those jokes. And you don't see that on the left anymore. No, you don't. You know, Tyrus was a good idea for Kamla. You know what's funny is she did say in her video, it's important to come together. And then she didn't show up. Right. Well, again, this isn't like we haven't seen her in public settings. And I'm pretty sure when her team found out that there was no teleprompter, there was going to be no Kamla. Like, it's just, she doesn't do well in those settings. We haven't figured out what interview settings she does well in yet. But we're pretty sure. We're pretty sure getting up there in front of people and telling jokes. And here's the difference. Trump said some ones that weren't so great, right? Because he, unfortunately, he didn't have time to prep. Yeah. Because somebody made him late. It was, hi. But he went and did it anyway. And even when they were bad, I think one of the funniest parts of the whole thing was like, well, this one's terrible. Yeah. Oh, wow, I should have read this one through. He was not afraid to make fun of himself. Now, in the clips there, there was a lot of tough jokes. And the comedians were throwing real shots at him. But every time they did, he smiled, he acknowledged it, he laughed, he took it on, he was gracious. That would not have happened the other side. We would have saw what happened. We saw when she, who gets mad at Brett Bear? How hard is it? Like, no one gets mad at Brett Bear. And when she was screaming at Brett Bear, what was she going to do when he said that? We would have seen a reaction that would not have been good for us. So she thought not showing up was the best move, which should let everybody know exactly where their campaign is at right now. Joey Gaffigan talking about mentioning the coup. It's like, that seems like a right wing talking point, but he's not a right winger. He's a Democrat. No, I think he brought some personal animus in there. Like, hey, he is not happy about how that went out. That's how it came across to me. Because it was less comedy than some of the things that Trump was saying. And props to him for giving everyone that might tune in something that they could watch and not need to turn away from. I mean, I can't turn into, like, I don't get overly upset about what artists think or what celebrities want. I don't, that doesn't stop me from enjoying their art when they're good actors and singers. But I can't tune into the Golden Globes or the Oscars or anything like that. Because they're not telling me, Trump is bad. They're telling me I'm bad. Yes. He didn't do that last night. And I appreciate him for it. And for Trump, I think the biggest power move he did was slapping Schumer on the back and being, he's an alright guy. Because they are so focused on demonizing Trump. Like, that's all they have right now. I mean, when you look at the top issues for Kamala at Reddapol today going on newsroom, the second most important issue was that she isn't Trump. They've programmed people to believe he's just the absolute worst thing that could ever happen. He goes up there and says, yeah, yeah, this guy hates me, but he's alright. That's a power move. That's being an alpha. Yeah, you know, Dagen, it's like, when I saw him do that to Chuck, it was like watching Batman, you know, give a wedgie to the penguin. LAUGHTER Jerry Nadler wasn't there. That was so true. He looks more like the penguin than Nadler. Speaking of Nadler, it would be like reaching over and going, I've always wanted to do this with the dandruff. And his brush and brush and off is a suit coat. Because he kept going back to Chuck Schumer. Yeah. And at that point, he said, Chuck, he's the one who got Biden out. He's the guy, much more so than Nancy Pelosi. I know him. He's the one who did it. No more he talked about Chuck Schumer. Chuck Schumer became more and more like Montgomery Burns. Yeah. He was just, he was shrinking. He was like, please, please stop talking about me. Chuck was loose and confident. After a long day, he was every, I mean, he did it. We're going to show clips of Tyrus' interview later in the show. But like, I would be in bed by now. I don't get it. And before that, he was in Wall Street. Yeah. Like big meetings. He got it.

Harris campaign 'nervous' about Trump's gains in swing states: Report,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAPmjL41tks,2024-10-18 20:45:02+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win Massachusetts by the largest margin?,0.6259822845458984," It's a sprint to the finish line for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump. Today, both candidates are holding rallies in the key battleground state of Michigan. And so far, it has been a fierce battle. New reports, meanwhile, say that Harris' team is getting nervous over Trump's gains just 18 days out from the election. Who can believe it? Hello, everyone. It's Friday. This is outnumbered. I'm Kayleigh McEnany. This is Dagan McDowell, Fox Business anchor and co-host of the bottom line on Fox Business. Tammy Bruce, Fox News contributor and president of American Spirit Enterprises. Dr. Nicole Staffyre, Fox News contributor and board certified physician. And Patrick J. Murphy, 32nd under Secretary of the Army and former Pennsylvania Congressman. Well, reports of anxiety and all-out panic are beginning. And it could have Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign spun up just a few days out from the election as time is running out. The New York Post reporting that Democrats in Pennsylvania, that whole important state, say that Harris is, quote, A-Wall in being out message. These are Democrats saying this. This has Reuters claims that anxiety is rising in the VP's campaign over Trump's swing state gains. And Democrats are telling Politico that they see warning signs for Harris with Latino men in the must-win state of Pennsylvania. You know, Dagan, one thing I love to do, and maybe it's because I was impressed in Combs, is read behind the headlines. And when you have Democrats coming out with anxiety, leaking to publications on the state Pennsylvania Democrats, national Democrats, it usually is a sign that there's some nerve-wracking appetites happening in the campaign. Right. And I also love to read into what the Senate candidates are saying. And if you look at, let's just look at Michigan, for example. So in the real clear politics average in Michigan, President Trump is up by almost one full point, 0.9 points. Alyssa Slotkin, up over microtters, 2.2 points in that state. And both of them, the big issue, and so you take a national issue, like the economy and inflation, and then you boil it down to each state issue. In Pennsylvania, it's fracking. Again. And in Michigan, it's the EV mandate, the electric vehicle mandate that is a job destroyer for auto workers. And it's something that no American wants, because they don't want to be told, oh, you cannot drive a car or a pickup truck with an internal combustion engine in it. So both Alyssa Slotkin, who's running for Senate as a Democrat, and Kamala Harris, have said both, I will never tell you what kind of car you are. It's hard you have to drive. Yeah, you have. She has, because the EPA tailpipe emissions regulation essentially mandates, is the de facto mandate that two thirds of the vehicles in eight years in the United States of America must be partially electric or fully electric. That is a mandate, and that is a killer for Kamala Harris and Alyssa Slotkin just in the state of Michigan. Well, Kelly, just, Digg is making a very good point here, because Kamala Harris did come out in 2019 for these EV mandates. Now she's backing off on them a little bit like she's doing with fracking, because she wants to get elected. But they're still being very savvy when it comes to these battleground states, because as we saw under the inflation reduction act, just in Michigan alone, they promise about $500 million to GM Motors. And so you have the unionized workers there saying, the union saying, if we don't get that handout from the IRA, if that goes away under a Trump presidency, jobs are going to be lost. And I feel like waving this little shiny thing in front of voters saying you need to vote for this now or lose jobs tomorrow. But that's so short-sighted, and they're not looking at the long term, and what will come, because with Kamala Harris presidency will come these EV mandates, and it will be a long-term demise of the auto industry. Yeah, we'll see if that happens. But Patrick, going back to Democrats and panic, I wanted to put up the national numbers for you. This is real clear politics. This is average of polling, so you can't dissect one poll. This is the average. And what you see nationally is Kamala Harris with a 1.6 percent lead. OK, you say. But Biden had an 8.9 percent lead in 2020 in Clinton who went on to lose, I would remind our viewers, had a 7.1 percent lead. Have they recalibrated polls? Who knows? That would make me jittery. Also, moments before coming to air, I see Bob Casey, your senator in Pennsylvania, up with an ad that literally says, Casey supports Trump's trade order. So when the Democrat candidate starts professing support for Trump, what does that say? Well, he's first of all, Bob Casey is a great American in supporting Kamala Harris. But I hear you, there's a special... But they're a policy, not for him as a candidate. Right, right, right, right. And listen, I was on the air here saying some of the Trump tariffs were good. His rhetoric this week, we're not going to, when he says John Deere, we're going to tie our few 200 percent just because it's 75 percent of manufacturing in America. As far as Michigan goes, let's be very clear. I drive a Jeep, right? The GM parent company, or GM and Jeep, they are investing a quarter billion dollars in Michigan, like making manufacturing cars. So that's a positive thing. And I would say it's not just through an election. I mean, I know they can mention fracking. Kamala Harris has been part of a team that has made it the largest increase in oil production, natural gas production, in American history. No, we were actually independent under Trump. It was a totally different policy. And this was somebody that's not... That's not that. ...that he at least wanted to ban fracking and then pivoted, oh wait, because she has to win votes. This... Can you leave us nine million barrels a day under Trump? It's now 13.2 million barrels a day of oil produced in America. That's all private land. That's all private land. It's not because of anything that the government... It's all production. The government does all the private land. Degin, can you explain the difference? They have restricted vastly the number of federal leases in the United States. They were required to issue leases under the Inflation Reduction Act, and it is a bare minimum. Like four, maybe, that they... I will look at the exact numbers. But the vast majority of oil production has come from what are called ducks, drilled, but uncompleted wells, which were drilled before Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took office. So those were already drilled. They didn't require new leases, number one. And the production has come from private land, not government land, largely. Vastable. Majority. Really quick. We'll project last summer. We'll have a million barrels a day up in Alaska. So... And the left came Biden and Kamala hard time, but the reality is that's what they did. And that's why we have this. Biden, Harris, is a benefit of the ingenuity of the private sector. Their own incompetence, notwithstanding. But look at this, Tammy. Democrats and panic nationally. And then you want to pull up the real clear politics swing state averages. Look at this. Trump is winning in every single swing state. It's in the margin of error. It is narrow. It is indeed a close race. All of that is true. But if I am Kamala Harris, this makes me very, very nervous because I am underperforming Biden four years ago. Right. And the trend, of course, she at one point was ahead in the majority of those states. Yes. But within the margin of error. So we've seen a trend from the beginning of Donald Trump. They did all kinds of things. Rated Mar-a-Lago, sitting in a trial, being indicted, being convicted. None of it affected him. Getting shot, almost, you know, shot at twice. None of it affected his trajectory. It's been a consistent move up. So it, I think what's happened is people do realize they know him. He's performed through all of this. None of this is a surprise. But Harris has not performed. People were waiting, including after the debate. Thinking, well, at the debate, we'll get some specifics. The focus groups after the debate were, we still didn't hear anything. The Brett Bayer interview, of course, is like that was another opportunity to, like, decide to be honest, did not happen even in the dinner last night with the video. She could have been funny herself, didn't do it. So what we're hearing with these leaks about her staff and that she's not there, she's not participating mirrors what we heard from her staff that constantly left when she, as being in the White House's vice president. It's the same kind of complaints, not engaged, not participating. We are lost. This is, we don't have direction. That's the, it's mirrors those complaints. It's not a surprise. They also got nervous too when she failed to get some of the key endorsements from some of the organized unions that Joe Biden got before. And that really does show that there is a break with union leaders and its members. And that's why it's so, very, very quick thing. That's being said. Two days ago, it was Washington's Cross-Cabaret County, my hometown. We had endorsements from Republicans. The Republican governor, Chris Whitman, you had Adam Kinsinger, you had Liz Cheney, you had Charlie Dent who represents the I-Fally. So you had dozens of Republicans that were endorsed. Absolutely. I'm pretty sure if Trump were sitting here now, he would say you can take those endorsements, I'll take my poll numbers and I'll take my one point advantage and voter registration nationally. And I'll take the chaos in the Trump, in the, in the Kamala campaign. And I will take Republican President Trump pro-energy agenda, three offshore lease sales scheduled in the next five years, the fewest in history, history. That's Biden and Harris. Dagen brings the receipts. Don't mess with Dagen McTown. Hey, everyone. I'm Emily Camponio.

And Democrats are telling Politico that they see warning signs for Harris with Latino men in the must-win state of Pennsylvania. You know, Dagan, one thing I love to do, and maybe it's because I was impressed in Combs, is read behind the headlines. And when you have Democrats coming out with anxiety, leaking to publications on the state Pennsylvania Democrats, national Democrats, it usually is a sign that there's some nerve-wracking appetites happening in the campaign. Right. And I also love to read into what the Senate candidates are saying. And if you look at, let's just look at Michigan, for example. So in the real clear politics average in Michigan, President Trump is up by almost one full point, 0.9 points. Alyssa Slotkin, up over microtters, 2.2 points in that state. And both of them, the big issue, and so you take a national issue, like the economy and inflation, and then you boil it down to each state issue. In Pennsylvania, it's fracking. Again. And in Michigan, it's the EV mandate, the electric vehicle mandate that is a job destroyer for auto workers. And it's something that no American wants, because they don't want to be told, oh, you cannot drive a car or a pickup truck with an internal combustion engine in it. So both Alyssa Slotkin, who's running for Senate as a Democrat, and Kamala Harris, have said both, I will never tell you what kind of car you are. It's hard you have to drive. Yeah, you have. She has, because the EPA tailpipe emissions regulation essentially mandates, is the de facto mandate that two thirds of the vehicles in eight years in the United States of America must be partially electric or fully electric. That is a mandate, and that is a killer for Kamala Harris and Alyssa Slotkin just in the state of Michigan. Well, Kelly, just, Digg is making a very good point here, because Kamala Harris did come out in 2019 for these EV mandates. Now she's backing off on them a little bit like she's doing with fracking, because she wants to get elected. But they're still being very savvy when it comes to these battleground states, because as we saw under the inflation reduction act, just in Michigan alone, they promise about $500 million to GM Motors. And so you have the unionized workers there saying, the union saying, if we don't get that handout from the IRA, if that goes away under a Trump presidency, jobs are going to be lost. And I feel like waving this little shiny thing in front of voters saying you need to vote for this now or lose jobs tomorrow. But that's so short-sighted, and they're not looking at the long term, and what will come, because with Kamala Harris presidency will come these EV mandates, and it will be a long-term demise of the auto industry. Yeah, we'll see if that happens. But Patrick, going back to Democrats and panic, I wanted to put up the national numbers for you. This is real clear politics. This is average of polling, so you can't dissect one poll. This is the average. And what you see nationally is Kamala Harris with a 1.6 percent lead. OK, you say. But Biden had an 8.9 percent lead in 2020 in Clinton who went on to lose, I would remind our viewers, had a 7.1 percent lead. Have they recalibrated polls? Who knows? That would make me jittery. Also, moments before coming to air, I see Bob Casey, your senator in Pennsylvania, up with an ad that literally says, Casey supports Trump's trade order. So when the Democrat candidate starts professing support for Trump, what does that say? Well, he's first of all, Bob Casey is a great American in supporting Kamala Harris. But I hear you, there's a special... But they're a policy, not for him as a candidate. Right, right, right, right. And listen, I was on the air here saying some of the Trump tariffs were good. His rhetoric this week, we're not going to, when he says John Deere, we're going to tie our few 200 percent just because it's 75 percent of manufacturing in America. As far as Michigan goes, let's be very clear. I drive a Jeep, right? The GM parent company, or GM and Jeep, they are investing a quarter billion dollars in Michigan, like making manufacturing cars. So that's a positive thing. And I would say it's not just through an election. I mean, I know they can mention fracking. Kamala Harris has been part of a team that has made it the largest increase in oil production, natural gas production, in American history. No, we were actually independent under Trump. It was a totally different policy. And this was somebody that's not... That's not that. ...that he at least wanted to ban fracking and then pivoted, oh wait, because she has to win votes. This... Can you leave us nine million barrels a day under Trump? It's now 13.2 million barrels a day of oil produced in America. That's all private land. That's all private land. It's not because of anything that the government... It's all production. The government does all the private land. Degin, can you explain the difference? They have restricted vastly the number of federal leases in the United States. They were required to issue leases under the Inflation Reduction Act, and it is a bare minimum. Like four, maybe, that they... I will look at the exact numbers. But the vast majority of oil production has come from what are called ducks, drilled, but uncompleted wells, which were drilled before Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took office. So those were already drilled. They didn't require new leases, number one. And the production has come from private land, not government land, largely. Vastable. Majority. Really quick. We'll project last summer. We'll have a million barrels a day up in Alaska. So... And the left came Biden and Kamala hard time, but the reality is that's what they did. And that's why we have this. Biden, Harris, is a benefit of the ingenuity of the private sector. Their own incompetence, notwithstanding. But look at this, Tammy. Democrats and panic nationally. And then you want to pull up the real clear politics swing state averages. Look at this. Trump is winning in every single swing state. It's in the margin of error. It is narrow. It is indeed a close race. All of that is true. But if I am Kamala Harris, this makes me very, very nervous because I am underperforming Biden four years ago. Right. And the trend, of course, she at one point was ahead in the majority of those states. Yes. But within the margin of error. So we've seen a trend from the beginning of Donald Trump. They did all kinds of things. Rated Mar-a-Lago, sitting in a trial, being indicted, being convicted. None of it affected him. Getting shot, almost, you know, shot at twice. None of it affected his trajectory. It's been a consistent move up. So it, I think what's happened is people do realize they know him. He's performed through all of this. None of this is a surprise. But Harris has not performed. People were waiting, including after the debate. Thinking, well, at the debate, we'll get some specifics. The focus groups after the debate were, we still didn't hear anything. The Brett Bayer interview, of course, is like that was another opportunity to, like, decide to be honest, did not happen even in the dinner last night with the video. She could have been funny herself, didn't do it. So what we're hearing with these leaks about her staff and that she's not there, she's not participating mirrors what we heard from her staff that constantly left when she, as being in the White House's vice president. It's the same kind of complaints, not engaged, not participating. We are lost. This is, we don't have direction. That's the, it's mirrors those complaints. It's not a surprise. They also got nervous too when she failed to get some of the key endorsements from some of the organized unions that Joe Biden got before. And that really does show that there is a break with union leaders and its members. And that's why it's so, very, very quick thing. That's being said. Two days ago, it was Washington's Cross-Cabaret County, my hometown. We had endorsements from Republicans. The Republican governor, Chris Whitman, you had Adam Kinsinger, you had Liz Cheney, you had Charlie Dent who represents the I-Fally. So you had dozens of Republicans that were endorsed. Absolutely. I'm pretty sure if Trump were sitting here now, he would say you can take those endorsements, I'll take my poll numbers and I'll take my one point advantage and voter registration nationally. And I'll take the chaos in the Trump, in the, in the Kamala campaign. And I will take Republican President Trump pro-energy agenda, three offshore lease sales scheduled in the next five years, the fewest in history, history. That's Biden and Harris. Dagen brings the receipts. Don't mess with Dagen McTown. Hey, everyone. I'm Emily Camponio.

Harris campaign 'nervous' about Trump's gains in swing states: Report,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAPmjL41tks,2024-10-18 20:45:02+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win New York by the largest margin?,0.6202042102813721," It's a sprint to the finish line for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump. Today, both candidates are holding rallies in the key battleground state of Michigan. And so far, it has been a fierce battle. New reports, meanwhile, say that Harris' team is getting nervous over Trump's gains just 18 days out from the election. Who can believe it? Hello, everyone. It's Friday. This is outnumbered. I'm Kayleigh McEnany. This is Dagan McDowell, Fox Business anchor and co-host of the bottom line on Fox Business. Tammy Bruce, Fox News contributor and president of American Spirit Enterprises. Dr. Nicole Staffyre, Fox News contributor and board certified physician. And Patrick J. Murphy, 32nd under Secretary of the Army and former Pennsylvania Congressman. Well, reports of anxiety and all-out panic are beginning. And it could have Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign spun up just a few days out from the election as time is running out.

She has, because the EPA tailpipe emissions regulation essentially mandates, is the de facto mandate that two thirds of the vehicles in eight years in the United States of America must be partially electric or fully electric. That is a mandate, and that is a killer for Kamala Harris and Alyssa Slotkin just in the state of Michigan. Well, Kelly, just, Digg is making a very good point here, because Kamala Harris did come out in 2019 for these EV mandates. Now she's backing off on them a little bit like she's doing with fracking, because she wants to get elected. But they're still being very savvy when it comes to these battleground states, because as we saw under the inflation reduction act, just in Michigan alone, they promise about $500 million to GM Motors. And so you have the unionized workers there saying, the union saying, if we don't get that handout from the IRA, if that goes away under a Trump presidency, jobs are going to be lost. And I feel like waving this little shiny thing in front of voters saying you need to vote for this now or lose jobs tomorrow. But that's so short-sighted, and they're not looking at the long term, and what will come, because with Kamala Harris presidency will come these EV mandates, and it will be a long-term demise of the auto industry. Yeah, we'll see if that happens. But Patrick, going back to Democrats and panic, I wanted to put up the national numbers for you. This is real clear politics. This is average of polling, so you can't dissect one poll. This is the average. And what you see nationally is Kamala Harris with a 1.6 percent lead. OK, you say. But Biden had an 8.9 percent lead in 2020 in Clinton who went on to lose, I would remind our viewers, had a 7.1 percent lead. Have they recalibrated polls? Who knows? That would make me jittery. Also, moments before coming to air, I see Bob Casey, your senator in Pennsylvania, up with an ad that literally says, Casey supports Trump's trade order. So when the Democrat candidate starts professing support for Trump, what does that say? Well, he's first of all, Bob Casey is a great American in supporting Kamala Harris. But I hear you, there's a special... But they're a policy, not for him as a candidate. Right, right, right, right. And listen, I was on the air here saying some of the Trump tariffs were good. His rhetoric this week, we're not going to, when he says John Deere, we're going to tie our few 200 percent just because it's 75 percent of manufacturing in America. As far as Michigan goes, let's be very clear. I drive a Jeep, right? The GM parent company, or GM and Jeep, they are investing a quarter billion dollars in Michigan, like making manufacturing cars. So that's a positive thing. And I would say it's not just through an election. I mean, I know they can mention fracking. Kamala Harris has been part of a team that has made it the largest increase in oil production, natural gas production, in American history. No, we were actually independent under Trump. It was a totally different policy. And this was somebody that's not... That's not that. ...that he at least wanted to ban fracking and then pivoted, oh wait, because she has to win votes. This... Can you leave us nine million barrels a day under Trump? It's now 13.2 million barrels a day of oil produced in America. That's all private land. That's all private land. It's not because of anything that the government... It's all production. The government does all the private land. Degin, can you explain the difference? They have restricted vastly the number of federal leases in the United States. They were required to issue leases under the Inflation Reduction Act, and it is a bare minimum. Like four, maybe, that they... I will look at the exact numbers. But the vast majority of oil production has come from what are called ducks, drilled, but uncompleted wells, which were drilled before Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took office. So those were already drilled. They didn't require new leases, number one. And the production has come from private land, not government land, largely. Vastable. Majority. Really quick. We'll project last summer. We'll have a million barrels a day up in Alaska. So... And the left came Biden and Kamala hard time, but the reality is that's what they did. And that's why we have this. Biden, Harris, is a benefit of the ingenuity of the private sector. Their own incompetence, notwithstanding. But look at this, Tammy. Democrats and panic nationally. And then you want to pull up the real clear politics swing state averages. Look at this. Trump is winning in every single swing state. It's in the margin of error. It is narrow. It is indeed a close race. All of that is true. But if I am Kamala Harris, this makes me very, very nervous because I am underperforming Biden four years ago. Right. And the trend, of course, she at one point was ahead in the majority of those states. Yes. But within the margin of error. So we've seen a trend from the beginning of Donald Trump. They did all kinds of things. Rated Mar-a-Lago, sitting in a trial, being indicted, being convicted. None of it affected him. Getting shot, almost, you know, shot at twice. None of it affected his trajectory. It's been a consistent move up. So it, I think what's happened is people do realize they know him. He's performed through all of this. None of this is a surprise. But Harris has not performed. People were waiting, including after the debate. Thinking, well, at the debate, we'll get some specifics. The focus groups after the debate were, we still didn't hear anything. The Brett Bayer interview, of course, is like that was another opportunity to, like, decide to be honest, did not happen even in the dinner last night with the video. She could have been funny herself, didn't do it. So what we're hearing with these leaks about her staff and that she's not there, she's not participating mirrors what we heard from her staff that constantly left when she, as being in the White House's vice president. It's the same kind of complaints, not engaged, not participating. We are lost. This is, we don't have direction. That's the, it's mirrors those complaints. It's not a surprise. They also got nervous too when she failed to get some of the key endorsements from some of the organized unions that Joe Biden got before. And that really does show that there is a break with union leaders and its members. And that's why it's so, very, very quick thing. That's being said. Two days ago, it was Washington's Cross-Cabaret County, my hometown. We had endorsements from Republicans. The Republican governor, Chris Whitman, you had Adam Kinsinger, you had Liz Cheney, you had Charlie Dent who represents the I-Fally. So you had dozens of Republicans that were endorsed. Absolutely. I'm pretty sure if Trump were sitting here now, he would say you can take those endorsements, I'll take my poll numbers and I'll take my one point advantage and voter registration nationally. And I'll take the chaos in the Trump, in the, in the Kamala campaign. And I will take Republican President Trump pro-energy agenda, three offshore lease sales scheduled in the next five years, the fewest in history, history. That's Biden and Harris. Dagen brings the receipts. Don't mess with Dagen McTown. Hey, everyone. I'm Emily Camponio.

Harris campaign 'nervous' about Trump's gains in swing states: Report,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAPmjL41tks,2024-10-18 20:45:02+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win Maryland by the largest margin?,0.612657904624939," It's a sprint to the finish line for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump. Today, both candidates are holding rallies in the key battleground state of Michigan. And so far, it has been a fierce battle. New reports, meanwhile, say that Harris' team is getting nervous over Trump's gains just 18 days out from the election. Who can believe it? Hello, everyone. It's Friday. This is outnumbered. I'm Kayleigh McEnany. This is Dagan McDowell, Fox Business anchor and co-host of the bottom line on Fox Business. Tammy Bruce, Fox News contributor and president of American Spirit Enterprises. Dr. Nicole Staffyre, Fox News contributor and board certified physician. And Patrick J. Murphy, 32nd under Secretary of the Army and former Pennsylvania Congressman. Well, reports of anxiety and all-out panic are beginning. And it could have Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign spun up just a few days out from the election as time is running out. The New York Post reporting that Democrats in Pennsylvania, that whole important state, say that Harris is, quote, A-Wall in being out message. These are Democrats saying this. This has Reuters claims that anxiety is rising in the VP's campaign over Trump's swing state gains. And Democrats are telling Politico that they see warning signs for Harris with Latino men in the must-win state of Pennsylvania. You know, Dagan, one thing I love to do, and maybe it's because I was impressed in Combs, is read behind the headlines. And when you have Democrats coming out with anxiety, leaking to publications on the state Pennsylvania Democrats, national Democrats, it usually is a sign that there's some nerve-wracking appetites happening in the campaign. Right. And I also love to read into what the Senate candidates are saying. And if you look at, let's just look at Michigan, for example. So in the real clear politics average in Michigan, President Trump is up by almost one full point, 0.9 points. Alyssa Slotkin, up over microtters, 2.2 points in that state. And both of them, the big issue, and so you take a national issue, like the economy and inflation, and then you boil it down to each state issue. In Pennsylvania, it's fracking. Again. And in Michigan, it's the EV mandate, the electric vehicle mandate that is a job destroyer for auto workers. And it's something that no American wants, because they don't want to be told, oh, you cannot drive a car or a pickup truck with an internal combustion engine in it. So both Alyssa Slotkin, who's running for Senate as a Democrat, and Kamala Harris, have said both, I will never tell you what kind of car you are. It's hard you have to drive. Yeah, you have.

This is average of polling, so you can't dissect one poll. This is the average. And what you see nationally is Kamala Harris with a 1.6 percent lead. OK, you say. But Biden had an 8.9 percent lead in 2020 in Clinton who went on to lose, I would remind our viewers, had a 7.1 percent lead. Have they recalibrated polls? Who knows? That would make me jittery. Also, moments before coming to air, I see Bob Casey, your senator in Pennsylvania, up with an ad that literally says, Casey supports Trump's trade order. So when the Democrat candidate starts professing support for Trump, what does that say? Well, he's first of all, Bob Casey is a great American in supporting Kamala Harris. But I hear you, there's a special... But they're a policy, not for him as a candidate. Right, right, right, right. And listen, I was on the air here saying some of the Trump tariffs were good. His rhetoric this week, we're not going to, when he says John Deere, we're going to tie our few 200 percent just because it's 75 percent of manufacturing in America. As far as Michigan goes, let's be very clear. I drive a Jeep, right? The GM parent company, or GM and Jeep, they are investing a quarter billion dollars in Michigan, like making manufacturing cars. So that's a positive thing. And I would say it's not just through an election. I mean, I know they can mention fracking. Kamala Harris has been part of a team that has made it the largest increase in oil production, natural gas production, in American history. No, we were actually independent under Trump. It was a totally different policy. And this was somebody that's not... That's not that. ...that he at least wanted to ban fracking and then pivoted, oh wait, because she has to win votes. This... Can you leave us nine million barrels a day under Trump? It's now 13.2 million barrels a day of oil produced in America. That's all private land. That's all private land. It's not because of anything that the government... It's all production. The government does all the private land. Degin, can you explain the difference? They have restricted vastly the number of federal leases in the United States. They were required to issue leases under the Inflation Reduction Act, and it is a bare minimum. Like four, maybe, that they... I will look at the exact numbers. But the vast majority of oil production has come from what are called ducks, drilled, but uncompleted wells, which were drilled before Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took office. So those were already drilled. They didn't require new leases, number one. And the production has come from private land, not government land, largely. Vastable. Majority. Really quick. We'll project last summer. We'll have a million barrels a day up in Alaska. So... And the left came Biden and Kamala hard time, but the reality is that's what they did. And that's why we have this. Biden, Harris, is a benefit of the ingenuity of the private sector. Their own incompetence, notwithstanding. But look at this, Tammy. Democrats and panic nationally. And then you want to pull up the real clear politics swing state averages. Look at this. Trump is winning in every single swing state. It's in the margin of error. It is narrow. It is indeed a close race. All of that is true. But if I am Kamala Harris, this makes me very, very nervous because I am underperforming Biden four years ago. Right. And the trend, of course, she at one point was ahead in the majority of those states. Yes. But within the margin of error. So we've seen a trend from the beginning of Donald Trump. They did all kinds of things. Rated Mar-a-Lago, sitting in a trial, being indicted, being convicted. None of it affected him. Getting shot, almost, you know, shot at twice. None of it affected his trajectory. It's been a consistent move up. So it, I think what's happened is people do realize they know him. He's performed through all of this. None of this is a surprise. But Harris has not performed. People were waiting, including after the debate. Thinking, well, at the debate, we'll get some specifics. The focus groups after the debate were, we still didn't hear anything. The Brett Bayer interview, of course, is like that was another opportunity to, like, decide to be honest, did not happen even in the dinner last night with the video. She could have been funny herself, didn't do it. So what we're hearing with these leaks about her staff and that she's not there, she's not participating mirrors what we heard from her staff that constantly left when she, as being in the White House's vice president. It's the same kind of complaints, not engaged, not participating. We are lost. This is, we don't have direction. That's the, it's mirrors those complaints. It's not a surprise. They also got nervous too when she failed to get some of the key endorsements from some of the organized unions that Joe Biden got before. And that really does show that there is a break with union leaders and its members. And that's why it's so, very, very quick thing. That's being said. Two days ago, it was Washington's Cross-Cabaret County, my hometown. We had endorsements from Republicans. The Republican governor, Chris Whitman, you had Adam Kinsinger, you had Liz Cheney, you had Charlie Dent who represents the I-Fally. So you had dozens of Republicans that were endorsed. Absolutely. I'm pretty sure if Trump were sitting here now, he would say you can take those endorsements, I'll take my poll numbers and I'll take my one point advantage and voter registration nationally. And I'll take the chaos in the Trump, in the, in the Kamala campaign. And I will take Republican President Trump pro-energy agenda, three offshore lease sales scheduled in the next five years, the fewest in history, history. That's Biden and Harris. Dagen brings the receipts. Don't mess with Dagen McTown. Hey, everyone. I'm Emily Camponio.

Harris campaign 'nervous' about Trump's gains in swing states: Report,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAPmjL41tks,2024-10-18 20:45:02+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win Hawaii by the largest margin?,0.6050580739974976," It's a sprint to the finish line for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump. Today, both candidates are holding rallies in the key battleground state of Michigan. And so far, it has been a fierce battle. New reports, meanwhile, say that Harris' team is getting nervous over Trump's gains just 18 days out from the election. Who can believe it? Hello, everyone. It's Friday. This is outnumbered. I'm Kayleigh McEnany. This is Dagan McDowell, Fox Business anchor and co-host of the bottom line on Fox Business. Tammy Bruce, Fox News contributor and president of American Spirit Enterprises. Dr. Nicole Staffyre, Fox News contributor and board certified physician. And Patrick J. Murphy, 32nd under Secretary of the Army and former Pennsylvania Congressman. Well, reports of anxiety and all-out panic are beginning. And it could have Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign spun up just a few days out from the election as time is running out. The New York Post reporting that Democrats in Pennsylvania, that whole important state, say that Harris is, quote, A-Wall in being out message. These are Democrats saying this. This has Reuters claims that anxiety is rising in the VP's campaign over Trump's swing state gains. And Democrats are telling Politico that they see warning signs for Harris with Latino men in the must-win state of Pennsylvania. You know, Dagan, one thing I love to do, and maybe it's because I was impressed in Combs, is read behind the headlines. And when you have Democrats coming out with anxiety, leaking to publications on the state Pennsylvania Democrats, national Democrats, it usually is a sign that there's some nerve-wracking appetites happening in the campaign. Right. And I also love to read into what the Senate candidates are saying. And if you look at, let's just look at Michigan, for example. So in the real clear politics average in Michigan, President Trump is up by almost one full point, 0.9 points. Alyssa Slotkin, up over microtters, 2.2 points in that state. And both of them, the big issue, and so you take a national issue, like the economy and inflation, and then you boil it down to each state issue. In Pennsylvania, it's fracking. Again. And in Michigan, it's the EV mandate, the electric vehicle mandate that is a job destroyer for auto workers. And it's something that no American wants, because they don't want to be told, oh, you cannot drive a car or a pickup truck with an internal combustion engine in it. So both Alyssa Slotkin, who's running for Senate as a Democrat, and Kamala Harris, have said both, I will never tell you what kind of car you are. It's hard you have to drive. Yeah, you have. She has, because the EPA tailpipe emissions regulation essentially mandates, is the de facto mandate that two thirds of the vehicles in eight years in the United States of America must be partially electric or fully electric. That is a mandate, and that is a killer for Kamala Harris and Alyssa Slotkin just in the state of Michigan. Well, Kelly, just, Digg is making a very good point here, because Kamala Harris did come out in 2019 for these EV mandates. Now she's backing off on them a little bit like she's doing with fracking, because she wants to get elected. But they're still being very savvy when it comes to these battleground states, because as we saw under the inflation reduction act, just in Michigan alone, they promise about $500 million to GM Motors. And so you have the unionized workers there saying, the union saying, if we don't get that handout from the IRA, if that goes away under a Trump presidency, jobs are going to be lost. And I feel like waving this little shiny thing in front of voters saying you need to vote for this now or lose jobs tomorrow. But that's so short-sighted, and they're not looking at the long term, and what will come, because with Kamala Harris presidency will come these EV mandates, and it will be a long-term demise of the auto industry. Yeah, we'll see if that happens. But Patrick, going back to Democrats and panic, I wanted to put up the national numbers for you. This is real clear politics.

Kamala Harris has been part of a team that has made it the largest increase in oil production, natural gas production, in American history. No, we were actually independent under Trump. It was a totally different policy. And this was somebody that's not... That's not that. ...that he at least wanted to ban fracking and then pivoted, oh wait, because she has to win votes. This... Can you leave us nine million barrels a day under Trump? It's now 13.2 million barrels a day of oil produced in America. That's all private land. That's all private land. It's not because of anything that the government... It's all production. The government does all the private land. Degin, can you explain the difference? They have restricted vastly the number of federal leases in the United States. They were required to issue leases under the Inflation Reduction Act, and it is a bare minimum. Like four, maybe, that they... I will look at the exact numbers. But the vast majority of oil production has come from what are called ducks, drilled, but uncompleted wells, which were drilled before Joe Biden and Kamala Harris took office. So those were already drilled. They didn't require new leases, number one. And the production has come from private land, not government land, largely. Vastable. Majority. Really quick. We'll project last summer. We'll have a million barrels a day up in Alaska. So... And the left came Biden and Kamala hard time, but the reality is that's what they did. And that's why we have this. Biden, Harris, is a benefit of the ingenuity of the private sector. Their own incompetence, notwithstanding. But look at this, Tammy. Democrats and panic nationally. And then you want to pull up the real clear politics swing state averages. Look at this. Trump is winning in every single swing state. It's in the margin of error. It is narrow. It is indeed a close race. All of that is true. But if I am Kamala Harris, this makes me very, very nervous because I am underperforming Biden four years ago. Right. And the trend, of course, she at one point was ahead in the majority of those states. Yes. But within the margin of error. So we've seen a trend from the beginning of Donald Trump. They did all kinds of things. Rated Mar-a-Lago, sitting in a trial, being indicted, being convicted. None of it affected him. Getting shot, almost, you know, shot at twice. None of it affected his trajectory. It's been a consistent move up. So it, I think what's happened is people do realize they know him. He's performed through all of this. None of this is a surprise. But Harris has not performed. People were waiting, including after the debate. Thinking, well, at the debate, we'll get some specifics. The focus groups after the debate were, we still didn't hear anything. The Brett Bayer interview, of course, is like that was another opportunity to, like, decide to be honest, did not happen even in the dinner last night with the video. She could have been funny herself, didn't do it. So what we're hearing with these leaks about her staff and that she's not there, she's not participating mirrors what we heard from her staff that constantly left when she, as being in the White House's vice president. It's the same kind of complaints, not engaged, not participating. We are lost. This is, we don't have direction. That's the, it's mirrors those complaints. It's not a surprise. They also got nervous too when she failed to get some of the key endorsements from some of the organized unions that Joe Biden got before. And that really does show that there is a break with union leaders and its members. And that's why it's so, very, very quick thing. That's being said. Two days ago, it was Washington's Cross-Cabaret County, my hometown. We had endorsements from Republicans. The Republican governor, Chris Whitman, you had Adam Kinsinger, you had Liz Cheney, you had Charlie Dent who represents the I-Fally. So you had dozens of Republicans that were endorsed. Absolutely. I'm pretty sure if Trump were sitting here now, he would say you can take those endorsements, I'll take my poll numbers and I'll take my one point advantage and voter registration nationally. And I'll take the chaos in the Trump, in the, in the Kamala campaign. And I will take Republican President Trump pro-energy agenda, three offshore lease sales scheduled in the next five years, the fewest in history, history. That's Biden and Harris. Dagen brings the receipts. Don't mess with Dagen McTown. Hey, everyone. I'm Emily Camponio.

Harris campaign 'nervous' about Trump's gains in swing states: Report,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAPmjL41tks,2024-10-18 20:45:02+00:00,Will Kamala Harris drop out of presidential race?,0.6016938090324402," It's a sprint to the finish line for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump. Today, both candidates are holding rallies in the key battleground state of Michigan. And so far, it has been a fierce battle. New reports, meanwhile, say that Harris' team is getting nervous over Trump's gains just 18 days out from the election. Who can believe it? Hello, everyone. It's Friday. This is outnumbered. I'm Kayleigh McEnany. This is Dagan McDowell, Fox Business anchor and co-host of the bottom line on Fox Business. Tammy Bruce, Fox News contributor and president of American Spirit Enterprises. Dr. Nicole Staffyre, Fox News contributor and board certified physician. And Patrick J. Murphy, 32nd under Secretary of the Army and former Pennsylvania Congressman. Well, reports of anxiety and all-out panic are beginning. And it could have Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign spun up just a few days out from the election as time is running out. The New York Post reporting that Democrats in Pennsylvania, that whole important state, say that Harris is, quote, A-Wall in being out message. These are Democrats saying this. This has Reuters claims that anxiety is rising in the VP's campaign over Trump's swing state gains. And Democrats are telling Politico that they see warning signs for Harris with Latino men in the must-win state of Pennsylvania. You know, Dagan, one thing I love to do, and maybe it's because I was impressed in Combs, is read behind the headlines. And when you have Democrats coming out with anxiety, leaking to publications on the state Pennsylvania Democrats, national Democrats, it usually is a sign that there's some nerve-wracking appetites happening in the campaign. Right. And I also love to read into what the Senate candidates are saying. And if you look at, let's just look at Michigan, for example. So in the real clear politics average in Michigan, President Trump is up by almost one full point, 0.9 points. Alyssa Slotkin, up over microtters, 2.2 points in that state. And both of them, the big issue, and so you take a national issue, like the economy and inflation, and then you boil it down to each state issue. In Pennsylvania, it's fracking. Again. And in Michigan, it's the EV mandate, the electric vehicle mandate that is a job destroyer for auto workers. And it's something that no American wants, because they don't want to be told, oh, you cannot drive a car or a pickup truck with an internal combustion engine in it. So both Alyssa Slotkin, who's running for Senate as a Democrat, and Kamala Harris, have said both, I will never tell you what kind of car you are. It's hard you have to drive. Yeah, you have. She has, because the EPA tailpipe emissions regulation essentially mandates, is the de facto mandate that two thirds of the vehicles in eight years in the United States of America must be partially electric or fully electric. That is a mandate, and that is a killer for Kamala Harris and Alyssa Slotkin just in the state of Michigan. Well, Kelly, just, Digg is making a very good point here, because Kamala Harris did come out in 2019 for these EV mandates. Now she's backing off on them a little bit like she's doing with fracking, because she wants to get elected. But they're still being very savvy when it comes to these battleground states, because as we saw under the inflation reduction act, just in Michigan alone, they promise about $500 million to GM Motors. And so you have the unionized workers there saying, the union saying, if we don't get that handout from the IRA, if that goes away under a Trump presidency, jobs are going to be lost. And I feel like waving this little shiny thing in front of voters saying you need to vote for this now or lose jobs tomorrow. But that's so short-sighted, and they're not looking at the long term, and what will come, because with Kamala Harris presidency will come these EV mandates, and it will be a long-term demise of the auto industry. Yeah, we'll see if that happens. But Patrick, going back to Democrats and panic, I wanted to put up the national numbers for you. This is real clear politics. This is average of polling, so you can't dissect one poll. This is the average. And what you see nationally is Kamala Harris with a 1.6 percent lead. OK, you say. But Biden had an 8.9 percent lead in 2020 in Clinton who went on to lose, I would remind our viewers, had a 7.1 percent lead. Have they recalibrated polls? Who knows? That would make me jittery. Also, moments before coming to air, I see Bob Casey, your senator in Pennsylvania, up with an ad that literally says, Casey supports Trump's trade order. So when the Democrat candidate starts professing support for Trump, what does that say? Well, he's first of all, Bob Casey is a great American in supporting Kamala Harris. But I hear you, there's a special... But they're a policy, not for him as a candidate. Right, right, right, right. And listen, I was on the air here saying some of the Trump tariffs were good. His rhetoric this week, we're not going to, when he says John Deere, we're going to tie our few 200 percent just because it's 75 percent of manufacturing in America. As far as Michigan goes, let's be very clear. I drive a Jeep, right? The GM parent company, or GM and Jeep, they are investing a quarter billion dollars in Michigan, like making manufacturing cars. So that's a positive thing. And I would say it's not just through an election. I mean, I know they can mention fracking. Kamala Harris has been part of a team that has made it the largest increase in oil production, natural gas production, in American history. No, we were actually independent under Trump. It was a totally different policy. And this was somebody that's not... That's not that. ...that he at least wanted to ban fracking and then pivoted, oh wait, because she has to win votes. This...

Laura Ingraham: Kamala Harris grandstands and repeats lines from consultants,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ODPgQnKtVU,2024-10-18 00:45:00+00:00,Kamala Harris blowout victory?,0.6474946737289429," Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. This is Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. As always, thank you so much for joining us. Our detelling tidbit from the New York Post today sheds more light on the friction between Kamala Harris and the man who actually won his party's primaries. At Etho Kennedy's funeral, Biden reportedly whispered to Obama, she's not as strong as me, according to this renowned lip reader who analyzed the conversation. Obama then answered in response, I know that's true. We have time. Well, not a lot, only 19 days, and there is a building consensus tonight that the political momentum, at least for now, is with Donald Trump. He did a Univision Town Hall yesterday, another hostile forum, and seemed to take it all in stride. No reports that he showed up late or tried to wrap the interview early, that's because he's confident of himself and of his understanding of the issues as complex as they are. Now this is a stark contrast to Kamala in the Fox Tim, and that's the focus of tonight's Angle. All right, last night we shed our instant reaction to Harris to sit down with Brett Baer, but now we have a better sense of just how badly it went for her and her own supporters inside and outside the campaign. Oh, they know it. The best that they could do, and I read pretty much everything today, the best they could do was try to portray her as Kamala in the lion's dim. The media's word of the day, tough. To the end of the day, this is all about one word, the word tough. It showed that Harris was tough. She showed a real toughness by going in there and standing toe to toe, and what was clearly an unfriendly venue. It was aggressive, it was tough, and she was absolutely fine. She has answered Kamala Harris every criticism that just come her way. All right, wait, wait. She was absolutely fine. Would anyone say that about that? It was absolutely fine. She answered every criticism. What interview were these people watching? Plus, shouldn't we assume that a party's nominee is going to be tough? Isn't that supposed to be kind of a given for this job description? Because I'm sure Kim Jong Un and, you know, Jeez and Penn, they're not tough at all. No, they're not tough. And if you really are tough, if you really are crushing it in an interview, why on earth would you want your staffers to cut it short? But in fact, that's exactly what happened. Madam Vice President, they're wrapping me very hard here. And they're giving me a hard wrap. Well, I thank you for the time. No, why didn't Madam Tough Lady wave off her staff when they were waving at Brett to rap? I mean, if, again, if you are just dominating an interview, if you're on the top of your game, you're reaching an entirely new audience, then why wouldn't you want it to breathe a little? Have a little fun. Well, here's some context. We were supposed to start at 5 p.m. We, this was the time they gave us. Originally, we were going to do 25 or 30 minutes. They came in and said, well, maybe 20. The Vice President showed up about 515. I had a dish mount there at the end. You know, I'm talking like four people waving their hands. It's got to stop. It was like the gymnastics, like, moving around. Now obviously, her calm staff saw what all of us saw. And it was not pretty. Now, it wasn't that Brett was getting combative. Brett was just doing what journalists used to do, asked serious questions. And yeah, occasionally follow up when questions are actually not answered. It's not that he was combative. It was that she was getting more visibly annoyed the longer it went on. Enter the verbal crutch. May I please finish? We have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired. So your Homeland Security Secretary said that 85 percent of apprehensions. I'm not finished. I have laid a citizenship for the illicit. Please finish. May I finish responding, please? But you have to let me finish. You have the wrong. And it wasn't just that. Your staff should have had her practice answering at least a few questions about her record. You got to answer questions, right? Without using the words, Donald Trump. She literally could not do this. They say the country is on the wrong track. 79 percent of them. Why are they saying that if you're turning the page, you've been in office for three and a half years. And Donald Trump has been running for office. But you've been the person helping me always. You and I both know what I'm talking about. You and I both know what I'm talking about. I actually don't know. That was the best line ever. I actually have no idea what you're talking about. I mean, no sense. Week, week, week. The woman who thinks she deserves to be president showed up late to an interview and then refused to answer straightforward, rather simple questions, that she should have answered three months ago. So the subtext throughout, I had to watch this again. It was torture. Whenever she was asked about her actual record or actual comments in the past, 2019, what she's trying to say is that I guess they all would have had more success and a lot more consensus. If Trump wasn't out there running for president and banging the drums, I guess that was her argument. Now she wanted to show the country that she is, in fact, a serious person with serious plans and solutions about how to repair our border and lift up our economy. But she didn't, because she can't. All she could do was what she always does. Grandstand and repeat lines that her consultants had her memorized. Now when Brett brought up the mother who blames Biden and Harris after her daughter was murdered by an illegal, this was the fainting emotion. I will tell you that I am so sorry for her loss. I am so sorry for her loss. Sincerely. But let's talk about what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions. First of all, when anyone says sincerely, it's like saying frankly, again, it's Trump's fault. This woman's daughter was murdered and she's trying to say it's Trump's fault or move to Trump, deflect to Trump. Again, this is not serious and it's not going to work in international relations. It's not going to work when you're dealing with Congress. It's not going to work period. What is she, ten? That's what my boys do. Oh, it's his fault. No, I deal with that all day long in my house. And with all the bromides flying, she sounded like chat GPT trying to mimic Maya Angelou. The vast majority of us have more in common than what separates us. I do believe the American people are ready to turn the page on the divisiveness and the type of rhetoric that has come out of Donald Trump. People are ready to chart a new way forward. Hmm, chart a new way forward and call them fascists. That's the new rhetoric. You know, again, a new way forward, it's more like rinse, repeat. Because five minutes earlier, this woman literally could not name one thing should do differently than Biden. The fact is Harris missed a huge opportunity last night and the best that the print media it could do was call the exchange testy. The Washington Post and New York Times followed suit using a better SAT word, calling the interview contentious. Ooh. Notice what they couldn't say. They couldn't say that she showed a mastery of the facts or that she laid out a bold agenda to differentiate herself from Biden in his unpopular record. She did none of the above. The fact is her staff was desperate to stop the interview because they knew the longer it went on, the weaker shank came across. They were like trainers at a boxing match throwing a towel on the ring to stop the fight. And that's the angle. Hey, Sean Hannity here.

Netanyahu speaks after IDF kills Sinwar: 'An important moment',https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wszv37Q6wVs,2024-10-17 19:15:00+00:00,Israel withdraws from Gaza before November?,0.6027405858039856," We can listen out. The greatest butchery sent the Holocaust, who, the one who, who murdered thousands of Israelis, has been eliminated today as we have committed ourselves to. He came to account with us. Hamas suffered a heavy blow today, but our target goal has not been completed to the dear families of the kidnapped. I tell you, it's an important moment in the war. We will continue with all force, until bringing all those who are dear to you, who are dear to us, who bring them all home. This is our outmost commitment, mine and ours. And to the residents of Gaza, Sinwa, ruined your lives. He told you he was a lion, but in reality, he hid it in a dark tunnel, and he was distraught killed when he ran away in fear from our soldiers. I want to repeat again, in a more clear manner, Hamas will no longer rule Gaza. This is the beginning of the day of after Hamas. It's a, it's a opportunity for you, Gaza's residents, to finally be freed of his tyranny. To the Hamas fighters, those who, I'm telling you all, whoever is holding our school, or to kin, whoever puts down his arms and allows our kin to bring a come out, will live, whoever, however, harms our kin, he's a dead man. This will all bring about a closer time to the victory over Hamas. The darkness has been retreating and the light has been rising. In the Gaza Sinwa and others are no longer, I tell you, the residents of the area, there's an opportunity to create a new future of peace and prosperity for everyone. Together we can, we can propose the curse and bring the blessing. Now the world knows why we insisted on not ending the war. And to get into a fiyah, this was the area where Hamas and many of the other architeris were hiding. I want to thank the IDF, the security forces, and there are no better ones than them. Again, we understand what happens to those who hurt us. We show the world how the good can destroy the win over the bad. The war is not over. It's a difficult war. And heavy price and toll is exact from us. My condolences to the families who have lost their dear ones, they're fighting in the last days as well, and they're so set to, as David said, I will pursue my pursuers until they're all destroyed. We're in a war of any independence. We have to be unified, to be brave, to be strong, and we fight together, and with the help of the Almighty, we will win."
"Kamala Harris is 'tanking' at the 'worst possible time,' GOP lawmaker says",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK9Rcgf5ENM,2024-10-17 18:30:38+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win the 2024 US Presidential Election?,0.6254106760025024," I have to repeatedly touting Joe Biden's fitness to serve before his dramatic exit, Kamala Harris, now dodging questions over the president's fitness during her interview right here on Foxwatch. When did you first notice that President Biden's mental faculties appeared diminished? Joe Biden, I have watched from the Oval Office to the situation room. He has the judgment and the experiment and experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people. Joe Biden is not on ballot. Just part of a 27 minute interview there. James Comer is the chairman of the House Oversight Committee and he joins us now. Congressman, good morning to you. So her goal coming on Fox News was to speak to our viewers who include Republican Democrats and independents and make the pitch for them to vote for her and the election come November. So do you think that she was successful in doing that? I do not. She's done so few interviews in her career, especially during her time as Vice President. The American people are curious. They want to see if she can answer questions articulately, if she's a real person, if she's intelligent. And I don't think she came away from that interview with any point at a time when the momentum is clearly on Donald Trump side. I've been saying this for a week and a half. I didn't know how the election was going to turn out. But now all the momentum in the world is on Trump side. Most voters make a decision in the last three weeks. So Donald Trump's peeking at the right time and Kamala Harris is tanking at the worst possible time for her. And that interview, unfortunately for her, didn't do anything to stop the bleeding. Yeah, follow up on what you just said. You told another news alley, you think Trump's going to sweep every single swing state. So we will see about that. One person who disagrees with you on that probably is one Hillary, Rodham Clinton. Here's what she said about the interview with Brett last night. Watch. What I'm seeing is a person who has the character, the values, the temperament, the discipline to be an absolutely first class president. And that's what I want the American people to see as well. She is doing exactly what she should and must do. She is staying focused on the North Star, winning this election and literally saving our country. Look, I think Democrats and Republicans can all agree we did not get specifics from Kamala last night, nor do we ever get them. But to what Hillary said there, did you see what she saw, namely, character, values, temperament, discipline and focus in Brett's interview last night? No, all I saw was a week presidential candidate that in my opinion, never would have emerged victorious out of a fair democratic primary. The Democrats want to talk about a threat to democracy blocking people like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer from running in a primary and just self-annoying Kamala Harris. That's not the democratic process. And with respect to Hillary Clinton, let's be honest, Hillary Clinton is patient zero of Trump during the syndrome. She was the first known case back in 2016. And here we are today. She's showing no signs of recovery. Yeah, and you said something interesting that momentum is on Trump's side right now. Over the summer, the momentum was in Kamala Harris' court clearly. And you're right. It does feel like there has been a shift in polling shows that. Why do you think that's happening right now? And do you think that it will last for the remaining 19 days until the election? The election is always about the economy. And this year, it's a different kind of economy type issue. It's about inflation. Most Americans haven't lived through inflation. And they're starting to realize that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, they've been in charge for the last three and a half years. And look what's happened over the last three and a half years. The Democrats and Congress being led by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have gone on a spending spree. That spending spree has created massive inflation. That's why whenever you're American, go to the grocery store, it costs more than it did the week before when they went to the grocery store. This is 100% a result of bad policies. Policies of the Biden-Harrit's administration. People remember back to the four years of the Trump administration and they're asking themselves, which administration was I better off personally in? Was it the Trump administration or the Biden-Harrit's administration? And people are coming to the realization that they were better off under Donald Trump. Crime was lower during Donald Trump. We had a secure border under Donald Trump. And I think they're going to come home and vote for Donald Trump in two and a half weeks. Before I let you go, election officials in Southern states grappling with the fall-off from dual hurricanes. Some ballots now potentially lost in the mail. There's also the issue if your roads are blown out by the hurricane, can you even get to a polling place? So, Congressman, in the 20 seconds we have remaining, how can we ensure that no one is disenfranchised because they're a hurricane victim? I think that people in those states need to vote early. They need to be able to vote in person the day, the first day that that's available. And that's rapidly approaching because if an absentee ballot was mailed out and they didn't receive it, then there could be some controversy and question about whether or not they're allowed to vote. So they need to be able to have plenty of time to take care of that. This election is too important not to vote and hopefully those people that have had such a hard time will be able to make time to go vote. I'm Steve Ducy. I'm Brian Kilme. That means, we are hard.

So her goal coming on Fox News was to speak to our viewers who include Republican Democrats and independents and make the pitch for them to vote for her and the election come November. So do you think that she was successful in doing that? I do not. She's done so few interviews in her career, especially during her time as Vice President. The American people are curious. They want to see if she can answer questions articulately, if she's a real person, if she's intelligent. And I don't think she came away from that interview with any point at a time when the momentum is clearly on Donald Trump side. I've been saying this for a week and a half. I didn't know how the election was going to turn out. But now all the momentum in the world is on Trump side. Most voters make a decision in the last three weeks. So Donald Trump's peeking at the right time and Kamala Harris is tanking at the worst possible time for her. And that interview, unfortunately for her, didn't do anything to stop the bleeding. Yeah, follow up on what you just said. You told another news alley, you think Trump's going to sweep every single swing state. So we will see about that. One person who disagrees with you on that probably is one Hillary, Rodham Clinton. Here's what she said about the interview with Brett last night. Watch. What I'm seeing is a person who has the character, the values, the temperament, the discipline to be an absolutely first class president. And that's what I want the American people to see as well. She is doing exactly what she should and must do. She is staying focused on the North Star, winning this election and literally saving our country. Look, I think Democrats and Republicans can all agree we did not get specifics from Kamala last night, nor do we ever get them. But to what Hillary said there, did you see what she saw, namely, character, values, temperament, discipline and focus in Brett's interview last night? No, all I saw was a week presidential candidate that in my opinion, never would have emerged victorious out of a fair democratic primary. The Democrats want to talk about a threat to democracy blocking people like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer from running in a primary and just self-annoying Kamala Harris. That's not the democratic process. And with respect to Hillary Clinton, let's be honest, Hillary Clinton is patient zero of Trump during the syndrome. She was the first known case back in 2016. And here we are today. She's showing no signs of recovery. Yeah, and you said something interesting that momentum is on Trump's side right now. Over the summer, the momentum was in Kamala Harris' court clearly. And you're right. It does feel like there has been a shift in polling shows that. Why do you think that's happening right now? And do you think that it will last for the remaining 19 days until the election? The election is always about the economy. And this year, it's a different kind of economy type issue. It's about inflation. Most Americans haven't lived through inflation. And they're starting to realize that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, they've been in charge for the last three and a half years. And look what's happened over the last three and a half years. The Democrats and Congress being led by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have gone on a spending spree. That spending spree has created massive inflation. That's why whenever you're American, go to the grocery store, it costs more than it did the week before when they went to the grocery store. This is 100% a result of bad policies. Policies of the Biden-Harrit's administration. People remember back to the four years of the Trump administration and they're asking themselves, which administration was I better off personally in? Was it the Trump administration or the Biden-Harrit's administration? And people are coming to the realization that they were better off under Donald Trump. Crime was lower during Donald Trump. We had a secure border under Donald Trump. And I think they're going to come home and vote for Donald Trump in two and a half weeks. Before I let you go, election officials in Southern states grappling with the fall-off from dual hurricanes. Some ballots now potentially lost in the mail. There's also the issue if your roads are blown out by the hurricane, can you even get to a polling place? So, Congressman, in the 20 seconds we have remaining, how can we ensure that no one is disenfranchised because they're a hurricane victim? I think that people in those states need to vote early. They need to be able to vote in person the day, the first day that that's available. And that's rapidly approaching because if an absentee ballot was mailed out and they didn't receive it, then there could be some controversy and question about whether or not they're allowed to vote. So they need to be able to have plenty of time to take care of that. This election is too important not to vote and hopefully those people that have had such a hard time will be able to make time to go vote. I'm Steve Ducy. I'm Brian Kilme. That means, we are hard.

Israel reportedly confirms death of top Hamas leader,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlxAr1GXVKY,2024-10-17 17:06:04+00:00,Yahya Sinwar still Hamas leader by October 31?,0.6672257781028748," Well, this is a Fox News alert. Reuters is now reporting that Israel's foreign minister has just confirmed the death of Hamas leader, Yaya Sinwar. Yaya Sinwar was responsible in the mastermind between the vicious October 7th attack. That was the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust. And Reuters is reporting that Israeli officials who were analyzing his dental records that he is, in fact, dead. We go to tray yinxed and hypha Israel with more on this developing story, Trey. Yeah, guys, good afternoon. According to reports, the leader of Hamas Yaya Sinwar is dead. We cannot independently confirm this, and I'm going to tell you why. There are two things ongoing at the moment. Israeli officials are using dental records, and they are using DNA to try to match Yaya Sinwar's DNA to DNA that Israelis have in their file. The dental records match, but we are waiting to report until the DNA test comes back, just given how high profile this figure is. But again, according to reports attributed to Israel's foreign minister, Israel cuts. Yaya Sinwar is dead. This follows an Israeli operation in southern Gaza today, reportedly in the city of Rafa, Gaza's third largest city that sits next to the Egyptian border. This was not a planned intelligence operation, according to officials, but rather a ground patrol that intercepted movement in southern Gaza. Ultimately, Israeli forces reportedly fired on that movement, and among the cell of Hamas militants was the leader, Yaya Sinwar. Now, Sinwar is a man who has been at the top of the Israeli target list since October 70 as one of three masterminds behind the massacre, along with Mohammed Death, a man who was killed in an Israeli air strike earlier this year, and Ismail Hania, a man who was killed in an explosion in the Iranian capital of Tehran over the summer. So now that this is confirmed, the three masterminds behind the massacre are dead. Now, Sinwar spent 22 years in an Israeli prison. He was released back in 2011 as part of a prisoner swap deal for a one-single Israeli soldier, Gailad Shalit. Shalit was exchanged for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Now, when Sinwar went back to Gaza, he was appointed to a defense minister-level position among Hamas's Al-Khassamber Gades, the military wing of Hamas, and then ultimately later took over as the leader of Hamas inside Gaza. The last time that I saw Sinwar was in 2021, the month was May, and he was giving a rally where an infamous photo of him was taken, holding a Palestinian child who was dressed as a member of the Al-Khassamber Gades. Sinwar is someone who has devoted his life to killing Israelis, despite the fact that the Israelis actually saved his life during brain surgery on him in the early 2000s, while he was still in prison. And following the October 7th massacre, he had been hiding in the tunnel network beneath Gaza. Some of the Israeli hostages who were released as part of the November cease-fire deal back in 2023 reported meeting him in the tunnels beneath Gaza City. And so this is significant news and an indication that the Israelis will continue to pick off the remaining Hamas leaders that exist still inside Gaza. They have destroyed the battalions within the Gaza Strip, but the question remains, what does this mean for the Romanian Israeli hostages inside Gaza? 101 of them are there. Around half of them are estimated to be alive, and Israeli sources are texting now. They are talking about this news that is taking place. We do expect to hear from Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later tonight, Israel time. And the Israelis, according to this source, are in communication with their American counterparts to discuss the operation that took place today. Again, according to our reporting, this was not a planned operation, but rather one that took place after our movement was identified inside the Gaza Strip. Again, the latest information that we have attributable to reports we are waiting for DNA evidence is that Yakh Yalcinoir, the leader of Hamas, is dead. Guys? Trey, I want to step back a moment. I want you to put this into perspective for our viewers. September 28th, you have the head of Hezbollah, Nasrallah, who was taken out. If this is true today, I mean, we're talking a span of three weeks here, the head of Hamas taken out. What kind of message, both heads of Iranian proxies? What message does this send to Iran? It sends a message that the Israelis are not afraid to take out the leadership of Iranian proxies, and behind the scenes also a message they're not afraid to target top officials. Now this comes at a very delicate time in the region, a time where the Israelis are planning a counterattack following that ballistic missile attack earlier this month against their country. And it also comes as Israeli forces are still operating on the ground inside Gaza and now in southern Lebanon. And I want to just take you back to something we discussed earlier, Israel's Defense Minister Yakh Yalant. He has a chart in his office, and on that chart it has all of the Hamas leadership and all of the Hezbollah leadership. At the top of that Hamas chart was Yakh Yalcinoir, and his photo was there and it did not have an ex across it, like many of the lower level leaders of Hamas. Today, Yakh Yalant will be crossing off Yakh Yalcinoir. And this sends a message to the Iranian regime, the regime that has funded these organizations, these proxy groups, not just in Gaza, but also in Lebanon and in places like Yemen, Iraq, and Syria, that the Israelis are going to continue operating until they take out the leadership and they greatly reduce the capabilities of these organizations. And I do want to just read you this statement that we're getting in just now from Israel's foreign minister, Israel Katz, on the record. And he says the master, the master murder Yakh Yalcinoir, who is responsible for the massacre and atrocities of October 7th, was killed today by IDF soldiers. Again, this is confirmation from a top Israeli official that Yakh Yalcinoir is dead. The Israelis have been waiting for more than a year to get this news. They know that Cinoir was one of the people who planned that brutal assault on October 7th when Hamas-Azal Khassambergay, along with gunmen from across the Gaza Strip, crossed into southern Israel on that dark day, slaughtering people in their homes, taking over Israeli military bases, and then dragging 250 hostages back into the Gaza Strip. Now it's not just Cinoir. It's all the other leaders of Hamas that have been taken out that raise questions about how the organization is going to negotiate moving forward. And what this means for the conversations that were reportedly still taking place. This is a major victory for the Israelis on the battlefield because they have taken out the leadership of this organization that they've been at war with over the past more than one year. And they're also, again, sending that message to Iran that they will continue to operate and weaken its proxies across the Middle East. And this gives one major thing we should talk about here. It gives Israel flexibility because as they take out the leadership of these organizations across the region. And as they greatly reduce the rocket and missile launching capabilities of not just groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad and Gaza, but also Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, about 17 miles behind me. This allows the Israelis to strike Iran when they decide to do so and have less concern about the possibility that proxies will be used to target Israeli population centers. They will have to worry, of course, about the ballistic missile threat from Iran. That's part of the reason that the American Thad missile defense system, a Lockheed Martin system, arrived here in Israel this week, along with American forces to defend against such an attack. But what they are facing today is quite different than what they were facing just over a year ago when Israel faced one of the most significant security failures in the country's history. But today, they can report, according to top officials, that the leader of Hamas Yakhya Sinoir is dead, Muhammad Def, the other mastermind behind the October 7th massacre is dead, Ma'al-Haniyah is dead, Hassan Nasrallah is dead, and many of the officials who were conducting these ground operations against Israel have been taken out. And so there's real questions about the hostages, but today you can expect Israeli leadership, including, according to our reports. And again, I just want to confirm this now because the source that we have been waiting on, and this is all real-time reporting. So if I can just read this for a moment, this source says confirmed they are releasing a statement shortly. So what this confirmed message is, this means that the Israelis, as of right now, have confirmed with both dental records and DNA evidence that Yakhya Sinoir is dead. And we've been waiting for hours to report this news to you because we always want to be right before we are first. And as we reported before, when there was a targeted operation against the leader of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah, Fox News knew right away because our sources were on the phone. We talked to them, we got the information and could confirm it. This was different because this was not expected. This was surprised the entire Israeli defense echelon and the public here in Israel. But again, as we can report right now, Yakhya Sinoir has been killed inside Gaza by Israeli forces. His body is currently in Israel after being tested to match the DNA to the mastermind behind the October 7th massacre. Wow. This is significant geopolitically significant for Israel, significant for the free world. You know, for our viewers' awareness, I just want to point out the way you're looking at, those are protests that are happening right now in Tel Aviv and in trayings just to emphasize what you said at this hour as we near the 1 PM Eastern time hour here on the east coast of the United States. Sinwar, who is responsible for the death of infant children, the hostage taking of American citizens, the death of American citizens, right now we can confirm he is dead, both confirmed with dental records and DNA. Yes, Fox News can confirm that the leader of Hamas Yakhya Sinoir is dead. One of the masterminds behind the October 7th massacre and a man who devoted his life to fighting Israel. And again, he spent 22 years in an Israeli prison. He was released as part of that 2011 prisoner exchange for Gilat Shalit. And he was able to go back into Gaza, take the position of a defense minister among Hamas, his Al-Khassam Brigades, and then ultimately lead all of Hamas inside Gaza. And the images that you see there on your screen are really important to talk about as we cover this story. It's the families of the hostages that remain inside the Gaza strip. They are urging the Israeli leadership to use this moment to reach some sort of agreement and get the remaining hostages out of Gaza. And because as we talk here and we should really dive into this just for a moment, because we've been covering this story for, I think it's 374 days now. And from the beginning of this coverage, we have focused on the families of the hostages and of the hostages that are still being held inside Gaza. We have set down with those who were released as part of the November cease-fire deal. Some of the hostages had actually met Yath Yath Yath Senwar in the tunnels beneath Gaza. And one conversation stands out to me of Shani Gorin, a woman from the community of Neroz along the Gaza border. And she said, we're still waiting for October 8th to begin. Because the Israeli public can't move forward. They have been waiting not just for the leadership of Hamas to be taken out, but arguably more importantly for their fellow citizens to return home. And so there are two major stories that we're covering here in parallel. And that is the death of Yath Yath Yath Senwar, the leader of Hamas, one of the masterminds behind that massacre. But now the question of what will happen to the remaining hostages inside Gaza. And as you can see on your screen there, Intel Aviv, Israel's second largest city of around 300,000 people. There are individuals in the streets, and I'm just seeing these images for the first time here. And I can tell you that those people are next to Israel's Ministry of Defense. They are at an area called Kaplan Square where they have gathered each and every week to demand some sort of agreement to bring their loved ones home. They are so worried that as the time is running out for these hostages, that if an agreement isn't reached to get the remaining alive hostages out of Gaza, that more funerals will have to take place in this country as the war continues. So this is certainly a turning point in the conflict. And this is also a moment for Israeli leadership to find a path forward to get the remaining hostages out of Gaza. And it comes as Israeli forces are still operating on the ground inside Gaza. They have targeted the Jabbali neighborhood in the northern part of Gaza in recent weeks. There are still Israeli forces operating on the ground in southern Lebanon against Hezbollah. This country is preparing for a counterattack against Iran. Defenses across the country remain on high alert, fearing attacks from Iranian proxies in places like Yemen with the Houthis or Iran backed Iraqi Shia militias in Syria and Iraq. And so there certainly could be some sort of response from the Iranian regime through its proxies in response to the killing of Yakisim War, the leader of Hamas. Tre, one final question for you. And you're still right about those hostages. I think about Kaffir Bevis, who is one-year-old Ariel Bevis's brother, who is five-year-olds. They're parents, Syrian, Yardin, and their family members who I follow. And I see every day pleading for the release or news about those little babies. It's, I can imagine a really big moment for them as they think about what this means for their family members. But as we think forward beyond this moment, apparently the individual who is very likely or at least in the top contenders to take over Hamas is in cutter right now, an individual by the name of Khalid Mishal. As we think forward to the future of Hamas, I mean, they're running out of options, the people to lead this organization. Yeah, we're talking about Khalid Al-Mashtal. And he is someone who previously worked in the political Bureau of Hamas. And why the killing of Yakisim War was so significant is because Sinwar led the military wing of Hamas previously before taking over for all of Gaza. He was the one who was able to put fighters out on the ground who would commit these ambushes against Israeli forces to train them to conduct that massacre. Many of the remaining Hamas leadership that still alive, and we still hear from them sometimes sources that I developed inside Gaza. And we ask them about the hostages. We ask them about the current situation. They are not military men. They are political leaders of Hamas, and they do not have that same power. Traiangst, thank you very much for that significant reporting at the Sour."
HIGHLIGHTS: The must-see Kamala Harris-Bret Baier interview,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0,2024-10-17 14:01:01+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win the 2024 US Presidential Election?,0.6311656832695007," the last three weeks to the election day. The Democratic nominee trying to make the case that she offers a new way forward despite being in power the last three and a half years. If you're turning the page, you're going to see the next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. If you're turning the page, you've been in office for three and a half years. And Donald Trump has been running for office. But you've been in the person helping me off. And he says he retired after the uh-oh concert, see that administration did and say and think differently. Madam Vice President, they're wrapping me very hard here. I hope you got to say what you wanted to say about Donald Trump. There are a lot of things that- I just wanted to say. There are a lot of things that are- Madam Vice President, they're giving me a hard wrap. Well, I thank you for the time. Okay, prior to that moment, Harris faced several tough direct questions like, how her presidency would differ from the current Biden-Harris administration? So, you're not Joe Biden, you're not Donald Trump, but nothing comes to mind that you would do differently? Let me be very clear. My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency. And like every new president that comes in to office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership. I, for example, am someone who has not spent the majority of my career in Washington, DC. Your campaign slogan is a new way forward, and it's time to turn the page. You've been Vice President for three and a half years. So, what are you turning the page from? Well, first of all, turning the page from the last decade, in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that has been designed and implemented to divide our country and have Americans literally point fingers at each other. That is turning the page. That is turning the page. That is about turning the page on rhetoric that people are frankly exhausted of Brett. You've been in office for three and a half years. And Donald Trump has been running for office. But you've been the person holding the office. Come on. You and I both know what I'm talking about. You and I both know what I'm talking about. I actually don't. What are you talking about? What I'm talking about is that over the last decade, people have become... But listen, over the last decade, it is clear to me, and certainly the Republicans who are on stage with me, the former Chief of Staff to the President of Donald Trump, former Defense Secretaries, National Security Advisor, and his Vice President, one that he is unfit to serve, that he is unstable, that he is dangerous. So when we had Brett Bear on yesterday to preview, the big conversation with Kamala Harris, one of the things I noted is that what Brett Bear is really good when it comes down to the research. And we saw that yesterday because it was questioned after question based on her record and prior statements. And I gotta be honest, she didn't meet the moment in the sense of having a response to those questions, but I think it was a better format for Kamala Harris versus some of the softball interviews that she's gotten. At least she rose to the cage in the sense of wanting to fight back. And so if you're on the left, maybe you applaud her, but if you're someone that's been waiting for the big interview, then you think Brett Bear for asking those tough questions. I was glad he pressed her on you've been the one that's been in office for three and a half years, and then it was almost that moment where she said, but I haven't been to Europe either. When she said, but Donald Trump was running. She said, but you're the one in office. You're the one that we're turning to for change. You wanna turn the page, but this is what you've stood for. He said in 2019, when you ran for president, you wanted to allow immigrants to apply for drivers licenses, free tuition, free healthcare. Do you still support that? Kamala said that was five years ago. I will follow the laws and then Brett said, but she chose Tim Wall. So you're running mate. And he signed all of this into state law. So do you support this? She hesitated and she said, we are clear. We will support federal law. Right. And you know, it's not- It's not a big deal. Right. Yesterday when Brett was on with us, as you alluded to, Lawrence, we talked a little bit about how she is a known filibuster. Yes. And as soon as he asked the first question, and she went into an answer that we've heard a million times, it was like she was reading a teleprompter, about 20 seconds in, he tried to refocus her on the actual question. And it was back and forth the whole time. I'll tell you this. If you and your family set this up as a drinking game, before it started, and you said, OK, every time she says Donald Trump, I'm going to take a shot. You would have been so stashed. Stashed. Yeah, I'm getting stashed. Stashed. That's a good word. I would say 10 minutes in, because she, every time, the going got tough, she went to Donald Trump. Ultimately, I think the campaign said, we want to be able to say we've done a tough interview. OK, they checked that box. They also say, Tim Walls has done a couple of interviews on Fox News Sunday back to back. The campaign, Brian Fallon, put out a statement, and he said that they reached an audience last night that do not hear a lot directly from her. And she showed her toughness. So I think they think it was a win. But the question that really, I think, is going to be played everywhere, was when Brett Behr asks a direct question, when did you know about the diminished faculties of the current president of the United States? And she turned to Donald Trump. And she went to Donald Trump. And there was a huge pause there as if she was not expecting that question. But the answer was not sufficient enough, especially when we witnessed Ansela on the debate stage. Right. I was watching Brett last night on Sean's show. And Sean was saying, you know, you were supposed to do a interview at five. He said she didn't walk out until 517. She knew he had a live show at 6 o'clock. She knew that he had to turn this. We had to get it into the tape room so that we could push play on that at 6 o'clock. She knew how stressful that would be for the staff, the team. And she knew she could eat into some of her time that she had promised Brett Behr. Brett said, we were supposed to have 25 minutes. And she only gave us 20 minutes. And he said, I don't like interrupting, but I had to interrupt a lot because she was filibustering. She just kept talking and talking about things I wasn't necessarily asking her about. He said, so I had to interrupt. But he said, if I hadn't interrupted, we would have probably gotten four questions in five minutes per question. He said, so I had 75 questions prepared. Right. He was very well prepared and he asked a lot of questions throughout the 26 minutes. One of the ways that Donald Trump has really made some hate in the last couple of weeks is with an ad talking about how she supports surgery for prisoners, gender changing surgery. And he asked her about that. And once again, she started an answer. And then she mentioned Donald Trump. Watch. So are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained illegal aliens to transition to another gender? I will follow the law. And it's a law that Donald Trump actually followed. You're probably familiar with now it's a public report that under Donald Trump's administration, these surgeries were available to on a medical necessity basis to people in the federal prison system. And I think frankly that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing stones when you're living in a glass house. The Trump aid say that he never advocated for that prison policy and no gender transition. Well, you know what happened during this? For what happened in your administration? Yeah, no surgeries happened in this pregnancy. It's in what I'm like. Would you still advocate for using taxpayer dollars for gender reassignment surgery? I will follow the law. Obviously she didn't answer it, Ansel. The yes or no question, which is do you support taxpayer funds going to gender reassignment? But that, I mean, she always traps herself. That last line, you got to take responsibility for what happens in your administration. So the border, the eight point, some million folks that have come across the border, the record inflation in this country, grocery prices going up, an economy that is not bouncing back. Maybe if you like the stock market, then you're happy with it. But if you're going to the grocery store, is she responsible since this is her administration? Yeah, I mean, she keeps saying I'll follow the law. I'll follow the law in the gender transitioning surgeries and prison. I'll follow the law when it comes to the border. Well, you have access to the law if you're the vice president. If you're running for president and you become president, you can change the law. There are executive orders. And they did away with most of Donald Trump's executive orders when it came to immigration. And Brett knows the facts and Brett really pressed her on this and said, what about immigration? How many of cross the border under your administration? She couldn't answer that. She pivoted and changed the subject. But she mentioned the amnesty bill again. And Brett said that would have given 11 million illegals amnesty, a pathway to citizenship. Because when she's asked about immigration, oh, and day one, right after hours within us taking the oath, we tried to pass the U.S. Citizenship Act. And then that's when Brett said that would have allowed 11 million people to get citizenship. That's an amnesty bill. And then she started talking about the bipartisan border bill that Donald Trump landed on Donald Trump, that it never passed. And Brett said that Democrats voted against it. And Democrats had problems with it. And that would have allowed 1.8 million illegals to be allowed in our country every year. That is not closing the border. So the question is, after the 26 minute interview, how many people who are watching Fox or saw the clips would actually say, you know, I was undecided, I'm going to change my mind. We've talked a little bit about how there are so few. There's just a narrow little sliver of the electorate that is undecided. But what's interesting, Fox News came out with a brand new poll yesterday. And it had some good news for Donald Trump. He is now leading her by two. She was ahead by two in the last poll. But what's interesting in the Fox poll, it says that 10% of his supporters and 10% about 10% of his supporters and about 10% of her supporters might change their mind. So ultimately, they took a high-risk gamble to come on Fox and get a great grill in by the great Brett Baer. Did she change any minds? It's interesting because earlier in the day, she appeared on stage there in Pennsylvania with a bunch of Republicans who said, okay, we're supporting her. One other fact from the Fox News poll is 20% of non-magger Republicans apparently are going to vote for her. The balance of them are going to vote for him."

It's interesting because earlier in the day, she appeared on stage there in Pennsylvania with a bunch of Republicans who said, okay, we're supporting her. One other fact from the Fox News poll is 20% of non-magger Republicans apparently are going to vote for her. The balance of them are going to vote for him."
HIGHLIGHTS: The must-see Kamala Harris-Bret Baier interview,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNxiLaY6I0,2024-10-17 14:01:01+00:00,Will Kamala Harris drop out of presidential race?,0.6090087294578552," the last three weeks to the election day. The Democratic nominee trying to make the case that she offers a new way forward despite being in power the last three and a half years. If you're turning the page, you're going to see the next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. The next one. If you're turning the page, you've been in office for three and a half years. And Donald Trump has been running for office. But you've been in the person helping me off. And he says he retired after the uh-oh concert, see that administration did and say and think differently. Madam Vice President, they're wrapping me very hard here. I hope you got to say what you wanted to say about Donald Trump. There are a lot of things that- I just wanted to say. There are a lot of things that are- Madam Vice President, they're giving me a hard wrap. Well, I thank you for the time. Okay, prior to that moment, Harris faced several tough direct questions like, how her presidency would differ from the current Biden-Harris administration? So, you're not Joe Biden, you're not Donald Trump, but nothing comes to mind that you would do differently? Let me be very clear. My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden's presidency. And like every new president that comes in to office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas. I represent a new generation of leadership. I, for example, am someone who has not spent the majority of my career in Washington, DC. Your campaign slogan is a new way forward, and it's time to turn the page. You've been Vice President for three and a half years. So, what are you turning the page from? Well, first of all, turning the page from the last decade, in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump that has been designed and implemented to divide our country and have Americans literally point fingers at each other. That is turning the page. That is turning the page. That is about turning the page on rhetoric that people are frankly exhausted of Brett. You've been in office for three and a half years. And Donald Trump has been running for office. But you've been the person holding the office. Come on. You and I both know what I'm talking about. You and I both know what I'm talking about. I actually don't. What are you talking about? What I'm talking about is that over the last decade, people have become... But listen, over the last decade, it is clear to me, and certainly the Republicans who are on stage with me, the former Chief of Staff to the President of Donald Trump, former Defense Secretaries, National Security Advisor, and his Vice President, one that he is unfit to serve, that he is unstable, that he is dangerous. So when we had Brett Bear on yesterday to preview, the big conversation with Kamala Harris, one of the things I noted is that what Brett Bear is really good when it comes down to the research. And we saw that yesterday because it was questioned after question based on her record and prior statements. And I gotta be honest, she didn't meet the moment in the sense of having a response to those questions, but I think it was a better format for Kamala Harris versus some of the softball interviews that she's gotten. At least she rose to the cage in the sense of wanting to fight back. And so if you're on the left, maybe you applaud her, but if you're someone that's been waiting for the big interview, then you think Brett Bear for asking those tough questions. I was glad he pressed her on you've been the one that's been in office for three and a half years, and then it was almost that moment where she said, but I haven't been to Europe either. When she said, but Donald Trump was running. She said, but you're the one in office. You're the one that we're turning to for change. You wanna turn the page, but this is what you've stood for. He said in 2019, when you ran for president, you wanted to allow immigrants to apply for drivers licenses, free tuition, free healthcare. Do you still support that? Kamala said that was five years ago. I will follow the laws and then Brett said, but she chose Tim Wall. So you're running mate. And he signed all of this into state law. So do you support this? She hesitated and she said, we are clear. We will support federal law. Right. And you know, it's not- It's not a big deal. Right. Yesterday when Brett was on with us, as you alluded to, Lawrence, we talked a little bit about how she is a known filibuster. Yes. And as soon as he asked the first question, and she went into an answer that we've heard a million times, it was like she was reading a teleprompter, about 20 seconds in, he tried to refocus her on the actual question. And it was back and forth the whole time. I'll tell you this. If you and your family set this up as a drinking game, before it started, and you said, OK, every time she says Donald Trump, I'm going to take a shot. You would have been so stashed. Stashed. Yeah, I'm getting stashed. Stashed. That's a good word. I would say 10 minutes in, because she, every time, the going got tough, she went to Donald Trump. Ultimately, I think the campaign said, we want to be able to say we've done a tough interview. OK, they checked that box. They also say, Tim Walls has done a couple of interviews on Fox News Sunday back to back. The campaign, Brian Fallon, put out a statement, and he said that they reached an audience last night that do not hear a lot directly from her. And she showed her toughness. So I think they think it was a win. But the question that really, I think, is going to be played everywhere, was when Brett Behr asks a direct question, when did you know about the diminished faculties of the current president of the United States? And she turned to Donald Trump. And she went to Donald Trump. And there was a huge pause there as if she was not expecting that question. But the answer was not sufficient enough, especially when we witnessed Ansela on the debate stage. Right. I was watching Brett last night on Sean's show. And Sean was saying, you know, you were supposed to do a interview at five. He said she didn't walk out until 517. She knew he had a live show at 6 o'clock. She knew that he had to turn this. We had to get it into the tape room so that we could push play on that at 6 o'clock. She knew how stressful that would be for the staff, the team. And she knew she could eat into some of her time that she had promised Brett Behr. Brett said, we were supposed to have 25 minutes. And she only gave us 20 minutes. And he said, I don't like interrupting, but I had to interrupt a lot because she was filibustering. She just kept talking and talking about things I wasn't necessarily asking her about. He said, so I had to interrupt. But he said, if I hadn't interrupted, we would have probably gotten four questions in five minutes per question. He said, so I had 75 questions prepared. Right. He was very well prepared and he asked a lot of questions throughout the 26 minutes. One of the ways that Donald Trump has really made some hate in the last couple of weeks is with an ad talking about how she supports surgery for prisoners, gender changing surgery. And he asked her about that. And once again, she started an answer. And then she mentioned Donald Trump. Watch. So are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained illegal aliens to transition to another gender? I will follow the law. And it's a law that Donald Trump actually followed. You're probably familiar with now it's a public report that under Donald Trump's administration, these surgeries were available to on a medical necessity basis to people in the federal prison system. And I think frankly that ad from the Trump campaign is a little bit of like throwing stones when you're living in a glass house. The Trump aid say that he never advocated for that prison policy and no gender transition. Well, you know what happened during this? For what happened in your administration? Yeah, no surgeries happened in this pregnancy. It's in what I'm like. Would you still advocate for using taxpayer dollars for gender reassignment surgery? I will follow the law. Obviously she didn't answer it, Ansel. The yes or no question, which is do you support taxpayer funds going to gender reassignment? But that, I mean, she always traps herself. That last line, you got to take responsibility for what happens in your administration. So the border, the eight point, some million folks that have come across the border, the record inflation in this country, grocery prices going up, an economy that is not bouncing back. Maybe if you like the stock market, then you're happy with it. But if you're going to the grocery store, is she responsible since this is her administration? Yeah, I mean, she keeps saying I'll follow the law. I'll follow the law in the gender transitioning surgeries and prison. I'll follow the law when it comes to the border. Well, you have access to the law if you're the vice president. If you're running for president and you become president, you can change the law. There are executive orders. And they did away with most of Donald Trump's executive orders when it came to immigration. And Brett knows the facts and Brett really pressed her on this and said, what about immigration? How many of cross the border under your administration? She couldn't answer that. She pivoted and changed the subject. But she mentioned the amnesty bill again. And Brett said that would have given 11 million illegals amnesty, a pathway to citizenship. Because when she's asked about immigration, oh, and day one, right after hours within us taking the oath, we tried to pass the U.S. Citizenship Act. And then that's when Brett said that would have allowed 11 million people to get citizenship. That's an amnesty bill. And then she started talking about the bipartisan border bill that Donald Trump landed on Donald Trump, that it never passed. And Brett said that Democrats voted against it. And Democrats had problems with it. And that would have allowed 1.8 million illegals to be allowed in our country every year. That is not closing the border. So the question is, after the 26 minute interview, how many people who are watching Fox or saw the clips would actually say, you know, I was undecided, I'm going to change my mind. We've talked a little bit about how there are so few. There's just a narrow little sliver of the electorate that is undecided. But what's interesting, Fox News came out with a brand new poll yesterday. And it had some good news for Donald Trump. He is now leading her by two. She was ahead by two in the last poll. But what's interesting in the Fox poll, it says that 10% of his supporters and 10% about 10% of his supporters and about 10% of her supporters might change their mind. So ultimately, they took a high-risk gamble to come on Fox and get a great grill in by the great Brett Baer. Did she change any minds?

IDF investigating possible death of top Hamas leader,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8afPCkwVRrI,2024-10-17 13:25:12+00:00,Yahya Sinwar still Hamas leader by October 31?,0.696003794670105," So we got some breaking news that may be happening right now in the Middle East, and this could be. That's right. But it's not right there for the show that it could be that Israel's military is looking into whether the top leader of Hamas, Yaha Sinwar, who was responsible for October 7th and many other atrocities. He may have been killed in a military operation in Gaza. We are checking into this. This would be really big news. We have a great guest coming up on it that's already booked for us. So we are in luck. Maybe remember now Sinwar and the history it has with the IDF and the Israeli government. This was a man who was under arrest and in prison in an Israeli jail. He had a brain condition. Israeli doctors operated on him and saved his life. While he was in prison, he learned to speak Hebrew perfectly. He was in 2006. There was a war between Hezbollah and the Israelis. And was all over one captive Israeli soldier by the name of Gila Jalit. The Israelis years later traded at least a thousand inmates for Gila Jalit's release out of Gaza. Sinwar was one of them. He goes on to become a leader within Hamas leadership in Gaza. He has believed to be the mastermind of October 7th. The Israelis and the IDF been going through these tunnels trying to find him. It was about a month ago when he made the request for a peace deal that would give him safe passage to cutter and spare his life. That was not accepted. And the lives of so many were not spared because of him. And Matt Finn is in Tel Aviv and Matt, do you have anything on this latest development possibly? Well, I can at least set the scene for you here in Tel Aviv and tell you right now. Today is a Jewish holiday. The streets have been relatively quiet. People have been reflecting across this city. So the news, this information is spreading rather quickly across Tel Aviv. The IDF has released a statement saying the recent strikes in Gaza have killed three people. One of them who may include their ultimate goal, Yawa Sinwar, the head of Hamas and the so-called mastermind of the October 7th attacks. This is something that Israel has been trying to, a person that Israel has been trying to get since the very beginning. This person has proved to be incredibly elusive. And the news breaking across Israel right now, the hope is that perhaps this elimination could potentially, potentially lead to some type of end to this war possible ceasefire. And really to set the stage for you here in Tel Aviv over the past couple of days, there's really been anticipation building for a potential large scale military strike by Israel against Iran in retaliation for the October 1st missile strike here in Israel. That air live on Fox really horrifying moment. Hundreds of rockets launched here into Israel. And since that time, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowed that Iran will pay for that strike. And so here on the streets, people have been waiting to see what that strike may look like. Local Israel reports have indicated that Israel has been ready to launch a wider scale attack that allegedly the sites have determined. And that really it's only a matter of time. So now we have this news break. And it is very significant in something that is spreading rapidly here in Tel Aviv back to you, Bill and Dana. That then thank you so much. We all follow this breaking news. We find out. Yeah. And if it's true too, what it changed, that could be."
"Watters calls out Kamala Harris, says she lied to Charlamagne",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWW93V1npjw,2024-10-17 00:30:35+00:00,Kamala Harris and JD Vance debate before election?,0.6037848591804504," 20 days ago, and it's crunch time for Kamala Harris. The Vice President is about to sit down with Brett Baer, her first Fox News interview since becoming the Democratic nominee. And that will air in full right after the 5 at 6 p.m. Taking time for questions. It's a shift in strategy after Harris cruised through a friendly media blitz of interviews on shows like Call Her Daddy, The Howard Stern Show, and even you might remember sharing a beer with Stephen Colbert. Harris also joining Charlene the God for a radio town hall. And although he's usually friendly, he did put Harris on the spot about the border crisis. Doesn't the Biden administration have to take some blame for the border, though? A lot of them blame? Because I mean, the first three years, y'all did get a lot of things wrong with the border. Charlene, within hours of being inaugurated, the first bill we passed before we did the inflation reduction act before we did the bipartisan infrastructure act before we did the the the safer communities act to deal with gun violence. First thing we dropped was a bill to fix the broken immigration system. Call Harris also taking questions from some of Charlene's listeners. One caller asking whether she'll implement reparations, which is something she has supported in the past. I am running to be a president for all Americans. That being said, I do have clear eyes about the disparities that exist and the context in which they exist, meaning history to your point. So my agenda, well, first of all, on the point of reparations, it has to be studied. There's no question about that. And I've been very clear about that position. All right, Jack, let's start with you because this interview is going to take place. Well, right now, during the five and it's going to air in an hour. Yeah, well, listen, I'm looking forward to, but I got to tell you, when she said in answer to the question about the border, I mean, the Charlie made the God clearly knows that there's been a 241% increase in border crossings, which she says within hours of being inaugurated. Before the first bill we passed before inflation reduction infrastructure, safe for communities, first thing we dropped was a bill to fix immigration. I checked HR one. The first bill they dropped has nothing to do with immigration. She is just not competent or she's lying. It's one of the two. It's about fair elections. It's about ending money in politics, public officials working for the public interest. It has nothing to do with it. Okay, that's number one. Number two, we're going to study reparations. We've been studying reparations for 150 years. They just studied in California. Gavin Newsom said, no way we're going to do it. And she tells us she's been very clear on it. And nobody knows where she stands. And I got to tell you, I give Charlotte into God credit for the questions that he put to her. And he asked if she was sorry about some of the stuff that's happened at the border. And her answer was no. When it would have been very easy to talk about the murders, the rapes, the drugs, the fentanyl, nothing. She's impervious to all that. But I love that her longest answer was on reparations. And we'd still want to wear she stands to show stuff. And that's like a 90-10 issue in terms of unpopularity, Jessica. But anyway, your thoughts on the Charlemagne, the God interview, or the one that we haven't seen yet that's happening right now? I thought it was great for her to sit down with Charlemagne. I should say as well, she was sat down with Roland Martin as well, another very popular. Very popular. Come on. You're being, you must know one or something. I'm not sure. Let me try. What I could reflect, I did not interrupt. In your face, as that were, this is it. She is having conversations directed squarely at black men who she is struggling with. And that is the smart thing that you should do. When you have three weeks out and you see that you are soft with a particular group. I think Charlemagne gives a great interview. And it gave it even more heft that he is someone who has been supportive of her and also critical. So he liked her in the 2019-2020 primary. And then he's talked before about what's gone wrong at the border. He's talked about things that he feels like he has gotten wrong about her, actually, that he thought a vice president could accomplish more than they necessarily could in real life. So I thought it was a really good discussion. Immigration is going to be a soft spot. We do see that people understand that Donald Trump was the one that torpedoed that bipartisan border deal. That James Langford, one of the most conservative senators, was a co-sponsor and authored it. But that will be a soft spot. What she didn't manage to do that I think is really good is to talk about this new agenda that they have for black men. So to talk about entrepreneurship and economic opportunity to talk about specific health care needs that affect the black community more specifically. And I see no reason I understand. People want to put this in the, it's just identity politics. And that's ridiculous. Money politics is implicit in good campaigning. Whenever you're talking to a group that has a certain set of concerns, you need to be able to address the way that their lives are. What their job life looks like, what their family life looks like. What their medical life looks like. And on the same day, she put out the agenda for black men. She also put out the agenda for rural America. Like farmers ranchers. They get free weed too. It's not free weed. Legal weed, do they get welfare too? Well, everyone should get legal weed. And that's actually something that's popular across the partisans. Don't get it for free, but legalizing weed. It's because you don't like sound. But it was done by targeted at a black, at a black audience. Yeah, but she put 2,000 black males in jail for that. Well, the difference between a Brett Barron and a Charlemagne interview is that she's not going to lie to Brett and get away with it. She lied to Charlemagne and Charlemagne didn't know he was being lied to because he's not a journalist. So when she says that I submitted an immigration bill on day one, no, she submitted an amnesty bill. It had nothing to do with border security. So she lied. Brett, as opposed to Charlemagne, will follow up. When she says, well, I want to do a study on reparations. Well, Madam Vice President, what are you looking to hear from in the study that you don't know right now? Or you were the Vice President and Senator, you could have commissioned your own study. Why didn't you do that then? Or Brett probably would get specific. Can I have an example when you say that you're the victim of misinformation? You say your career has been victimized by misinformation about your accomplishments. Well, who? Well, what accomplishments specifically, the fact that you worked at McDonald's? Because when she was the Attorney General, there's really no significant case. When she was Senator, there was real no significant legislation. And the only thing she's known for as VP is the borders are. And that's been a mess. So hopefully tonight we'll get pointed questions. Maybe after a week and a half, what would you do differently than Joe Biden? She could come up with an answer there. Or why should men play women's sports? That's a good one. So Brett's going to be fair. He's going to be firm. He was pretty tough on Trump in the spring. And he'll be the same way with Kamala. What are you looking for tonight? Are you paying attention to the reparations issue? I mean, we have. I thought this up. I have to remind everybody that I'm not running for office. So I don't need a commission to say I'm going to study something that everybody hates. The idea of saying, I have been really clear that we need to study in a commission on something is a politician's way of saying, if I actually endorse it, my career is over. She knows that. This is what Gavin Newsom did. It's the only play you have. Today you're going to appoint a commission, put people on it. They get free croissants and ice water at their little meetings with the little tumblers. They get to feel really important, but you're not getting my money. You're not getting anybody's money. It's not going to happen. And I'll tell you why. The original sin of reparations is that it states that a person's problems are superior to your own based on an unquantifiable measure. So a healthy young person with endless job opportunities has a built in edge ancestral oppression over a poorer, sicker person with limited resources. That is actually the definition of systemic racism to say a young black person with great choices today should have their problems matter more than a white person, a Mexican person, an Asian person. That is racism. And if reparations is based on the stain of slavery than every human living today possesses that ancestral strain. Slavery is not solely performed by whites. Do your history. America just happened to fight a war to end it. This is why politicians pay lip service on this crap because they know if you explore the concept, hey, who's your ancestor? How many of them had slaves? My God, Jamaicans had slaves, didn't they? I don't know. You know, all of a sudden you start looking in your history and you go, this is impossible. It's absolutely impossible. So the only way around it to appease activists and all the activists really want is to be on that commission. That's all they want. That's all they're going to get. Yep. And then they'll study it to death. They'll study it to death and then they'll have another study. But study some other things while you're at it. Okay. Good chat, everybody. Up next, former president Trump speaks directly to women, voters and a Fox News town hall.

This isn't working anymore for Kamala Harris: Banderas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B8Z4XXoYFY,2024-10-16 21:00:00+00:00,Kamala Harris wins the popular vote?,0.620110273361206," Having now to the campaign trail, Vice President Kamala Harris has been losing ground with black male voters in an effort to rally their support back. The Vice President sat down for an interview with the radio host Charlemagne and suggested that she is open to reparations. My question to you is, what's your stance on reparations? We all know that America became great, you know, off the backs of free black labor. How progressive are you on making it a priority and writing America's wrongs? It's understood that you are running for president for all people of America asking for specifics for black communities doesn't mean don't do for others, but black Americans are heavily asked to vote Democrat and every election for over half a century with very little in return. What are your plans to address these very important issues and change that narrative? To your point, yes, I am running to be a president for all Americans. That being said, I do have clear eyes about the disparities that exist and the context in which they exist, meaning history to your point. So my agenda, well, first of all, on the point of reparations, it has to be studied. So this sounds a lot different than what she said in 2019 and I want to play that. It's important to recognize this contrast, so watch. She's black people getting reparations. I think there has to be some form reparations and we can discuss what that is. Quite different and notably, Julie, the Washington Post had a poll that should 70% of Americans are against this. Okay, I have clear eyes too when wearing contact lenses, as she just mentioned. So I'm glad she's great. But in hindsight, if you look at former President Obama coming out and basically calling out adult black men for getting behind Kamala Harris, just because they're black, there's no other reason. I have clear eyes. The reason why she's saying all of this and also calling for reparations and also telling the black community, oh, and by the way, if I legalize marijuana nationally, your whole community is going to benefit. What kind of BS is that? And she's basically doing this because she's losing the black vote. I mean, she still is ahead of Trump on the black vote, but historically speaking, the Republicans have never been this strong when it comes to the minority vote. And that's what they're afraid of because they're way too comfortable in states like Pennsylvania, for example, where she's bombing quite frankly. They're so comfortable on getting the blue collar vote, the minority vote, specifically the black and the Hispanic vote. Well, guess what? It's not working anymore because it hasn't worked for four years. Hispanics are sick and tired, legal Hispanics of the illegal immigration and the black and minority communities are also sick and tired of not being able to put food on their tables. So that's not working anymore. And pandering to the black community quite frankly, I believe, is insulting. Yeah. And Charlemagne did ask about the failure at the border from the Biden-Harris administration. Take a listen. But does that mean the Biden-Ministeration have to take some blame for the border, though? A lot of them blame? Because I mean, the first three years, you know, I did get a lot of things wrong with the border. No, Charlemagne, within hours of being inaugurated, the first bill we passed before we did the inflation reduction act before we did the bipartisan infrastructure act before we did the safer communities act to deal with gun violence. First thing we dropped was a bill to fix the broken immigration system, which by the way, Trump did not fix when he was president. All right. So let's talk about that bill that dropped in January when they first took over. Here's the fact sheet from that bill. You can still find this on the White House website. You can see President Biden is sending a bill to Congress on day one to restore humanity and American values to our immigration system. The bill provides hardworking people who enrich our communities every day and who have lived here for years, in some cases decade, an opportunity to earn citizenship. Molly, the bill did have minimal investments in border technology, but the premise of the bill was legalizing immigrants. Yeah. So one of the answers, this is a consistent answer from Democrats sort of across the board when they get asked about the border is an issue broadly. They point back to a bill and then they blame the other side for not advancing this bill or doing this thing or the other thing. And a lot of people say, look, there are other things that also could have happened. So going back to a bill that never passed doesn't seem to give a broader answer to Americans. That's part of the reason I think it was smart for her to go on with Charlemagne the God because she does need to get into these nooks and crannies and some of the voters that she's lost over the years. There's the gender gap, the enormous gender gap. Black women say they support her, 70 percent of black men said the same and then it's even a lesser degree. This is the New York Times, Sienna, pull 25 percent of young black men say they support Trump in November. So I think it was smart for her to go on to have some of these answers. But this particular answer that's been sort of a mantra doesn't seem to advance any ground. So another mantra we hear all the time, Paul, is I was a prosecutor and I prosecuted the gangs in the car tells, well, here's a fact check from none other than CNN on that very point. Watch this. One of Harris's first major controversies happened just months after she was a little elected San Francisco district attorney in 2004. Police officer Isaac Espinosa was gunned down by a gang member. Just 29, he was a young father and devoted husband to Renata Espinosa who had to identify his body in the hospital. I remember I walk into this room and he still had blood here. He was laying there with his eyes closed and I saw the blood here. I've no one to have it. I was just like wake up. Harris publicly announced she would not seek the death penalty against Espinosa's killer. The killer was a gang member. No death penalty. That's the kind of prosecution works she did. Yeah, and when she was agey, let's look at a couple of things that she did. First of all, she wrote the ballot measure, the line literally on the ballot for Proposition 47, I think it was that essentially dumbed down the criminal justice system. California is still living with that and in fact, they're about to vote on it and undo it. I'd love to see her get that question now to see how do you support now? The fact that they can undo one of your signature things. Secondly, she also presided over as the AG top-prosicune California, the disbanding of the California Bureau of the Card Conforcement, which was essentially a mini DEA that existed in California. All those agents were looking to it. This doesn't get a lot of media. All the agents in that were looking for, hey, save us here. We need you. And this is one of the opioid thing is going on. Now she lets it expire, all right? Then you have things like that. Then she's the border czar, which is an enforcement role. She doesn't go to the border to find out. Now they'll claim this, oh, you and other borders are, you will root cause czar. Okay, as root cause czar, did you go once at all to do the border, talk to a border patrol agent and say, what is the root cause? Why they coming? Who are these people? Are any of them gang members? You got any sources into prisons that are in the holding cells that are telling you? Who's being trafficked? Who are all these little kids that are on a company? Then where are they going once they get in? We know where they're going. A lot of them are being human trafficking. I could go on and on about this. Speaking of the border, I border on speechless when they say, we're the ones who will go on the border and the Republicans, when Donald Trump stopped this border nonsense. As soon as he came in, they undid it. You know, all of that is absolutely correct. And I'm curious from you, Kennedy. Does the Charlemagne interview break through? He has a huge audience, millions of listeners. Does it change anything? No, it doesn't change anything. He's interviewed her on the past. And he pressed her where the members of the black community have the most issue and that's with competing for jobs in big cities. And that's something that he's been very outspoken about. And this is actually a layup for her. This would be a great way for her to differentiate herself from President Biden while telling the truth at the same time. Because people can see and feel the effects of the immigration and border failure. And so what he's asking her is a little bit of accountability to say, yeah, you know, we tried and it didn't work, but she has to lie about it. And people know what the numbers are. I mean, that's one thing where it's not theoretical. Like, there are actually fewer border crossings under President Trump than there are in the three years of this administration. So that is one area where she could say, yeah, we didn't do enough. We didn't do it right. And we can do better and she is incapable of doing that. The thing that I do like about Charlie Maine is at least he's trying to get it the truth. And he is trying to find common ground with people that he disagrees with. I've seen that firsthand with him.

'The fear card': Harris ramps up outrageous claims against Trump,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlLed01XjW8,2024-10-16 19:30:10+00:00,"Will Kamala say ""marijuana"" during Fox News interview?",0.6698080897331238," So can you imagine black voters, especially black males saying, this is what we want. We want our economy, the work for us. We want to just afford things that a day on the basis. We hate what's happening at the border because they're taking job different resources from our communities. We don't like what's happening in the schools today with them trying to replace their parents with all this reproductive stuff and transgender stuff. And then you have a, this is what we want to see. We tell you what the issues that matter to us. And then release in a policy proposal with stuff that we never said that we want it from the government. And they think this is gonna work three weeks before election. I'm not sure she gets a bump after this. Well, it's clear pandering. We were talking about that yesterday. One of the reasons, Connolly Harris is stepping outside of her comfort zone. She's gonna be on special report with Brett tonight. And he's gonna ask, he is just, you know, he is the best in the business. He's gonna ask some really good questions. Political playbook talked a little bit this morning about why she would appear on Fox. And essentially what they said is she's trying to expand her appeal to people who don't normally, you know, vote democratic. And that is in particular they suggest. Fox News has a lot of Nikki Haley Republicans who are still shopping around. They suggest. So is that what's going on? We don't know, but we just know she's gonna sit down with Brett and she's gonna take a bunch of questions. And tomorrow morning we're gonna talk about her answers. Yeah, when you look at, when you hear Connolly Harris and we're gonna play a little bit of the Charlemagne to God interview, her plans don't help a lot of families and including like student loan forgiveness, that's gonna be $1 trillion. $25,000 for her first time home buyers. This isn't gonna help any of us, right? 20 billion for forgivable loans for African Americans and promise to, and promise to consider this reparation plan. That's gonna be multi trillion dollars. Promise is to legalize weed. Well, I don't smoke pot. I don't think any of y'all do either. That's not gonna help. Sex change surgeries for illegals and convicted criminals. Did you expect us to say whether or not we smoke pot but it's your business. To generalize and think that is the black community smokes both for black men, which is it would be an insult. Well, I don't even know the number one consumer of weed. Well, and Charlemagne, the God, asked her about that, you know, you roll out this initiative aimed at black men and talk about pot and she said that certain demographics are disproportionately impacted by marijuana laws. All right, so let's talk about what has been against, essentially changing the schedule on marijuana for a long time. All right, let's talk about one thing that she, one thing about Kamala Harris and we watched it for the last three and a half years and we watched it when she was a candidate. She's got a lot of people who have been asking for that she's been asking for that speech herself over and over again that she has talking points and she repeats them. And now she's trying to run from them and never explaining why she changed her mind on those talking points. And now that she's a candidate, she's got her same talking points. Charlemagne, who's known her since she was out in Los Angeles, asked her about that criticism about how she sticks to the script. Listen. But what do you say to people who say you stay on the talking points? I would say you're welcome. I love having conversations, which is why I'm so happy to be with you this afternoon. And the reality is that there are certain things that must be repeated to ensure that I have everyone know what I stand for and the issues that I think are at stake in this election. And so it requires repetition. You know, some people say that until someone has heard the same thing at least three times, it just doesn't stay with you. They say that in marketing. You tell them what you're gonna tell them, and then you tell them what they told them. But ultimately, it just seems like she repeats what you're gonna tell them. Well, he originally said, some say you have an inability to fearlessly say who you are and what you believe. We all feel that way about her. She said there's certain things that must be repeated, like you heard. She said, I say the same thing when I go to Detroit as I do in Philly to make sure the people here and receive what I think. Because if you go to each of her rallies, it's in a teleprompter and she just repeats the same speech. So the question is first, is thank you a proper response to that? You're welcome. It just, are you welcome? You said you're welcome, yes. So I just don't understand why that was even incorporated in her response. The second thing is no one is saying that she can't be like any other politician to have a stump speech. You know, some of the most effective politicians do, they have a theme and they hit that stump speech, every single stop that they go into it and it's something memorable. The problem is the stuff that she puts out there, it's not something that you want to be repeated again, it's just a word salad each time. But a couple of things, this will never happen again. Because we're never, I don't think, in our lifetime, ever going to have a politician untested just anointed. Right. So if she came out and said these are bad before, then they go and they go for eight months. They do fight with each other and they have debates, they have town halls and then they lose a debate. They win a debate and then there's caucus, primary, caucus primary in and out. And then all of a sudden you have a whole message. So no one would ever accuse it, someone again, just staying with your talking points because you can't win that way. She was an anointed, burst out. This is what she's saying. Hope to coast. Right. Holds drop and now she's got to go engage everywhere rapidly. And we're seeing, would seen in many ways, spin at a control and we're going to find out tonight if she's going to survive it. I also think the other thing they're going to do is try to make Trump unelectable again. And they're not bringing up the legal stuff because that makes them stronger. What they're going to try to say is he's lost his money 78 and he's kind of crazy. And by the way, they talk about what happened at ABC. They talk about what happened the other night and with him playing DJ. And it's a total lie too. So do you know, I watched Terry Moran who is not a Trump fan. I watch him be pretty abrasive. He covered this story. He said, I know on the outside, it looked kind of different. But on the inside, the spirit was great. It was really a great moment. That is an ABC reporter. People were injured. People were injured. They had to bring in medical care. Right. So I didn't want to keep speaking. I didn't want to get too far off, but I was just trying to say, they're trying to make them unelectable and they're trying to scare people. They'll roll. Any enemy's going to be arrested and jailed. Listen. Hi, I'm Bobby from Georgia and I have a question for Kamala Harris. Could you please respond to Trump's claim that he's going to use the Alien Enemy's Act of 1798 to round up immigrants if he wins the election? This law was last used to put Asian Americans in internment camps during World War II. And I have a sneaking suspicion that if Trump wins, he's going to use this law to put anyone that doesn't look white in camps. And I'm scared. Yeah. So you've hit on a really important point and expressed it, I think, so well, which is he is achieving his intended effect to make you scared. He is running full time on a campaign that is about instilling fear. Not about hope. Not about optimism. Not about the future, but about fear. And so this is yet another example. You know what? The irony is that she's been playing the fear card. She's playing the fear cards. And also it's illegal immigrants. It's not just immigrants in general. And also was there a follow-up to say the majority of Americans now support mass deportation of illegal immigrants? It's not a fear tactic. You know who's people, the people in fear, the people that have had guns pointed at them in their own apartment complexes, taken over bodegas, going after people in the middle of Times Square, the old ladies with the purses being stripped on people on mopeds that shouldn't be in the country. Those are the people that are fearful right now. Well, and so there she is talking about how Donald Trump is, you know, it's a bad guy, direct to democracy. We've heard all that stuff a million times by now. What's interesting is during her interview with Charlemagne the God, it was, you know, he did ask some good questions. He had some good questions. And she said stuff we have not heard her say before, which is interesting. However, she's going to investigate reparations. She's going to consider that. Well, well, she just has expanded on things that we hadn't heard before. But then again, it was a friendly audience because he pretty much said Donald Trump is a racist or rather a fascist and that Donald Trump should be in prison. But while she tries to paint him as the world's worst person, here's Donald Trump yesterday actually trying to make people feel optimistic about the future. And that's why he wants to be president again. With your vote, we will create millions of new great-paying jobs, wages will sort. Your taxes, your taxes are going to fall. You saw that. Your net worth will skyrocket. America will be confident again. You know, America has lost its confidence. It's a terrible thing to say. I said at one time and I said, you know, it's actually true. But it's going to come back very quickly. America will be respected again. The American people will be optimistic again. And you will be proud of the life and the future you are going to give and giving to your children. Our legacy will be nothing less than the rebirth of the American dream. For everyone who's calling the show and worried about whatever Donald Trump might do, might put everybody in camps if you're not white. So so. He was president for four years. He just wants to keep illegal immigrants out of the United States. He wants them to pay their fair share and to do it the right way. That's it. It's not so scary. It's just if you're here illegal, you should be paying taxes. Either you're a citizen or you're not. And if you're not, he says he's going to remove them. He's going to do away with sanctuary cities. He's going to bring down the cost of food at the grocery store. He's going to bring down the price of gas. Your energy bill is going to be cut 50%. Those are things that Americans care about. We care about safety and we care about the money in our bank accounts. Right. And also think he's out working or. Totally. He's his schedule is a lot thicker. It's a lot more substantive. And he just went with that Bloomberg interview instead of a friendly CNBC interview. He's going to be going on. I sure this townhold is going to have some abrasive, aggressive questions on him today with Univision. And I look forward to seeing Harris Faulkner's town hall today at 11 o'clock. So me too. I was talking to two ladies last night and one of them has a young son. And she said, you don't know, worry about our national security. She said, because if we have another war, my son, I don't want him drafted. And I thought, wow, I haven't thought about that. Because I mean, I've heard other moms say that. But having a little girl, you don't think about that. But we can't, when it comes to our national security, Trump is so strong. Well, and one of the things he's strong on is the border. And the border really is national security. 100%. Because there are so many people coming in here. And we were talking a little bit about the Afghan national who we heard from the administration. Yeah, he was vetted three times. One better than all. That's embarrassing. Of course, we won't get any answers to those questions about him until after the election. Because he is proof that they're letting in pretty much anybody without checking him. I'm Steve Juicy. I'm Brian Killme. And I mean, Slayerhart.

Holds drop and now she's got to go engage everywhere rapidly. And we're seeing, would seen in many ways, spin at a control and we're going to find out tonight if she's going to survive it. I also think the other thing they're going to do is try to make Trump unelectable again. And they're not bringing up the legal stuff because that makes them stronger. What they're going to try to say is he's lost his money 78 and he's kind of crazy. And by the way, they talk about what happened at ABC. They talk about what happened the other night and with him playing DJ. And it's a total lie too. So do you know, I watched Terry Moran who is not a Trump fan. I watch him be pretty abrasive. He covered this story. He said, I know on the outside, it looked kind of different. But on the inside, the spirit was great. It was really a great moment. That is an ABC reporter. People were injured. People were injured. They had to bring in medical care. Right. So I didn't want to keep speaking. I didn't want to get too far off, but I was just trying to say, they're trying to make them unelectable and they're trying to scare people. They'll roll. Any enemy's going to be arrested and jailed. Listen. Hi, I'm Bobby from Georgia and I have a question for Kamala Harris. Could you please respond to Trump's claim that he's going to use the Alien Enemy's Act of 1798 to round up immigrants if he wins the election? This law was last used to put Asian Americans in internment camps during World War II. And I have a sneaking suspicion that if Trump wins, he's going to use this law to put anyone that doesn't look white in camps. And I'm scared. Yeah. So you've hit on a really important point and expressed it, I think, so well, which is he is achieving his intended effect to make you scared. He is running full time on a campaign that is about instilling fear. Not about hope. Not about optimism. Not about the future, but about fear. And so this is yet another example. You know what? The irony is that she's been playing the fear card. She's playing the fear cards. And also it's illegal immigrants. It's not just immigrants in general. And also was there a follow-up to say the majority of Americans now support mass deportation of illegal immigrants? It's not a fear tactic. You know who's people, the people in fear, the people that have had guns pointed at them in their own apartment complexes, taken over bodegas, going after people in the middle of Times Square, the old ladies with the purses being stripped on people on mopeds that shouldn't be in the country. Those are the people that are fearful right now. Well, and so there she is talking about how Donald Trump is, you know, it's a bad guy, direct to democracy. We've heard all that stuff a million times by now. What's interesting is during her interview with Charlemagne the God, it was, you know, he did ask some good questions. He had some good questions. And she said stuff we have not heard her say before, which is interesting. However, she's going to investigate reparations. She's going to consider that. Well, well, she just has expanded on things that we hadn't heard before. But then again, it was a friendly audience because he pretty much said Donald Trump is a racist or rather a fascist and that Donald Trump should be in prison. But while she tries to paint him as the world's worst person, here's Donald Trump yesterday actually trying to make people feel optimistic about the future. And that's why he wants to be president again. With your vote, we will create millions of new great-paying jobs, wages will sort. Your taxes, your taxes are going to fall. You saw that. Your net worth will skyrocket. America will be confident again. You know, America has lost its confidence. It's a terrible thing to say. I said at one time and I said, you know, it's actually true. But it's going to come back very quickly. America will be respected again. The American people will be optimistic again. And you will be proud of the life and the future you are going to give and giving to your children. Our legacy will be nothing less than the rebirth of the American dream. For everyone who's calling the show and worried about whatever Donald Trump might do, might put everybody in camps if you're not white. So so. He was president for four years. He just wants to keep illegal immigrants out of the United States. He wants them to pay their fair share and to do it the right way. That's it. It's not so scary. It's just if you're here illegal, you should be paying taxes. Either you're a citizen or you're not. And if you're not, he says he's going to remove them. He's going to do away with sanctuary cities. He's going to bring down the cost of food at the grocery store. He's going to bring down the price of gas. Your energy bill is going to be cut 50%. Those are things that Americans care about. We care about safety and we care about the money in our bank accounts. Right. And also think he's out working or. Totally. He's his schedule is a lot thicker. It's a lot more substantive. And he just went with that Bloomberg interview instead of a friendly CNBC interview. He's going to be going on. I sure this townhold is going to have some abrasive, aggressive questions on him today with Univision. And I look forward to seeing Harris Faulkner's town hall today at 11 o'clock. So me too. I was talking to two ladies last night and one of them has a young son. And she said, you don't know, worry about our national security. She said, because if we have another war, my son, I don't want him drafted. And I thought, wow, I haven't thought about that. Because I mean, I've heard other moms say that. But having a little girl, you don't think about that. But we can't, when it comes to our national security, Trump is so strong. Well, and one of the things he's strong on is the border. And the border really is national security. 100%. Because there are so many people coming in here. And we were talking a little bit about the Afghan national who we heard from the administration. Yeah, he was vetted three times. One better than all. That's embarrassing. Of course, we won't get any answers to those questions about him until after the election. Because he is proof that they're letting in pretty much anybody without checking him. I'm Steve Juicy. I'm Brian Killme. And I mean, Slayerhart.

Trump hits back after being labeled 'dangerous' by Dems,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah7Snk-KFEA,2024-10-16 16:15:06+00:00,Kamala Harris wins the popular vote?,0.6006885766983032," The full hour this morning of a town hall with former President Donald Trump, my team and I traveled to the beautiful town of coming just outside of Atlanta in the battleground state of Georgia. I'm Harris Faulkner. You are in the Faulkner focus. The race to the White House and that state could not be closer. Trump holds a lead over Vice President Kamala Harris of less than a full percentage point in the real clear politics average of polls. If there is any doubt about whether voters there are invested, this will put those doubts to rest. Early voting kicked off in Georgia and the record was shattered yesterday. More than 300,000 people casting a ballot in a single day. More than doubling the number from 2020. And this is key information. You'll see why in just a moment. In 2020, President Biden won the women's vote by 12 points over former President Trump. And a recent Fox News poll shows Vice President Kamala Harris is up among women by 10 points. The audience there, along with me, the former president, all women. They put very specific and sometimes very personal questions to Trump on issues which matter most to them. The economy, crime, safety, abortion, child care, illegal immigration, protecting women and girls in sports, those questions and Trump's answers now. I want to introduce the 45th President of the United States, the Republican nominee for this year's presidential election, Donald J. Trump. Welcome. So I have to tell you, I'm getting a little taste of what it's like to roll with you. So early voting, just so you know, for the state of Georgia, just began. And they're already at a quarter million people in early vote. That will break a record in the state. And I cannot believe how people come for you already. I don't know if you know this, but early voting is a sign that people are coming out, as you know. But it's also a sign that there might be a few people who have something to say. So I want to share with you, senators Warnauken, Arsoph, Mayor Bottoms and Atlanta Mayor Bottoms. And Amber Thurmond's family have come out on a press call. And they're doing what's called a pre-bottle to our town hall right now. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. And I want to get... You can get better ratings, I promise. I want to get your reaction to something, because I was a little thrown back about how quickly this fight would start. No, by the way, Tim Walls, the governor of Minnesota who wants to be the next vice president, his wife is showing up. Where? Tomorrow, here. Yeah, she has an issue with the women's issues, town hall. All right, so let's take a look at what Senator Warnauken had to say. I want to get, for the first time, former president Trump's reaction to what's going on here in Georgia. Let's watch. If you do not vote as a vote, as a vote for Donald Trump, it's the send this man one step closer to the White House, which finally let me say will be literally dangerous or so much, so many of the people that we know dangerous as we've demonstrated for women. But this man, let me remind the black men who are listening to men of color, communities of color. He will be dangerous... You are up with minority voters. Yeah, I love that. Vice president Kamala Harris is hurting right now in that category of voting block. And they know all women are at this town hall. This is a pre-bottle from a short time ago. Your reaction. Well, I would say this. We just got the endorsement of Border Patrol all over... I mean, all over the country. Border Patrol, virtually every share of department, every police department, the fraternal order of police, 400,000 police, the biggest in the country. We have every... Wow. We have every single... I don't think they have a policeman or a police woman single. And we have the border, we have the safest border in the history of our country. Now we have the most unsafe border in the history of our country. So when you talk about safety, we had... It was just announced, as you know, last week, 13,099 murders were released into our country. Drug dealers, drug addicts, drug... Everybody is released into our country. We've never had anything like this. We've never had a mess like this. 625,000 criminals released into our country along with 21 million people. We have no idea who they are. And you know, that's just a sound bite. I don't know this guy, but he got lucky as hell to win. I'll tell you that much. But it's a sound bite that they like to use. And remember this law enforcement is with me 100% and we have to keep our community safe. And we have to take these murders that they've allowed to come through open borders without knowing anything about them. We have to take those people and we have to remove them. We have to get them out of our country. We're going to get into all of it. I want, first of all, a show of hands. Who voted early today? All right. Sounds good. Oh, and they're waving... Who did they vote for? I wonder who. That was the first thing you wanted to know. How about you? I say who did you vote? So another show of hands. How many of you actually feel good about how the economy is right now? No. You have our first question on the economy. We will start there. Your first name, please, and tell us your hometown. My name is Lisa, and I live in the city of Milton. First of all, welcome back to Georgia, President Trump. Thank you very much. Americans are concerned about the state of our economy. Democrats argue that your policies favor the wealthy, especially through tax cuts for billionaires, while the middle class continues to struggle these last three and a half years under the Biden-Harris administration. Could you outline your plans to revitalize the economy again as President and policies that specifically support the middle class when reelected? Sure. Thank you very much. Great question. That's sort of an easy question for me to answer because we have tremendous wealth in this country, but it's under our feet. It's called liquid gold. And we're going to bring down your energy costs, and with that everything's going to follow. We're also going to make it possible for companies to come into our country again. You know, we've lost so many businesses. If you're in a furniture making like in North Carolina, just they're flocking out of our country because we have politicians that don't know what to do. We're bringing them all back. We have a tax rate that's going to lure them, and we're going to protect them with tariffs so they can make money and so they don't get stolen. But we're going to have record-setting jobs. And just to know, I mean, the advantage I have is that I've done it. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country. We had never had an economy. And remember this, we also had the safest border in the history of our country. We never had a border that safe. The famous graph that I looked at, you know, my all-time favorite piece of paper. I mean, even my all-time favorite, I love that piece of paper. But that shows you that day, the day I left office, the border was the safest it ever was in the history of our country. We had the fewest number of people. We had the least amount of drugs. Everything was human trafficking, which is now 12 times higher than it was. And it's trafficking. I hate to say this mostly in women. It's a vicious thing because of the internet and because of this administration, maybe more so than the internet. But we had the safest border. We had the best economy. Think of it. A combination of security and finance and all of the other things. And we're going to make it even better. We're going to make the border even better. But the border can't. I mean, we did things with the border that nobody could have done, including built, we built 571 miles of wall. And that wall worked. And I got Mexico to give us soldiers, a lot of soldiers, 28,000 soldiers to protect us. I said, you have to protect us because you're letting all of these criminals come into our country. You have to protect us. They said, we're not going to do it. I said, good. And I'm just going to tariff all your goods until you do it. They said, like I said, we're going to do it. And they gave us. They gave us the solution. So we had great protection. And we had the best economy in the history of our country. Okay. Let's get back to the economy. The American Health Ranking Organization, 70.7% of Americans aged 65 and over voted in the past presidential election. So women are the largest, registered, and active group of voters. Social security is important to some women and people over the age of 65 or a very large voting block as well. You have said that you would not tax some of that Social Security money. How would that work? You're not going to tax any of the Social Security money, the benefits that go to seniors, because what you've done, what they've done to you with inflation is a disaster. It's the economy. But in terms of really the numbers, it's the inflation. We had the worst, they say it's in 48 years, I say ever. We had the worst inflation in the history of our country. And the ones that really got hurt, the worst are people that are in a fixed income, like our seniors. And I said we're not going to tax Social Security benefits on our seniors. And we're not going to do that. And that will a little bit more than even make up to what you look. I mean, you lost a fortune. You went up, again, they say 21%, I think it's 50%, and all of that money you're in a fixed income, people that were buying breakfast, they could no longer buy breakfast. They have a case. A woman goes up to the counter with three apples and then she says, oh, I can't afford it. She brings one apple back. That's not supposed to be our country. That's not our country. All right, let's move to a big campaign issue. I don't know if many people thought this would be where we are at this point. But in the election and in this country, transgender issues have become a focal point and races up and down the ballot. How many of you are worried about biological men and boys competing against women and girls in sports? Just show me. That's almost the entire room. That is the entire room. Yes. And I know you have a question. You do. It's so crazy. It's so crazy. Your question, your name and your hometown. My name is Linda and I'm from Milton, Georgia. But originally Brooklyn, New York. Oh, yeah. I'd get that. My question is, how do you plan on addressing the transgender issue in women's sports? I have nine grandchildren, six of them female, all playing sports, and we are very concerned for their safety, not just on the field and the courts, but in their locker rooms as well. It's such an easy question. And everybody in the room and you know that answer, we're not going to let it happen. You look just yesterday, they had a volleyball match. Did you see that? Yeah. Where a person that transitioned, okay? We have to be very careful because this can terminate your political career if you say it's slightly off, all right? But transitioned from man to female and was on a volleyball. And I saw the slam. It was a slam. I never saw a ball hit so hard. I hate the girl on the head, but other people, even in volleyball, they've been permanently, I mean, they've been really hurt badly, women playing, men, but you don't have to do the volleyball. We stop it. We stop it. We absolutely stop it. You can't have it. It's a man playing in the game. I mean, physically, from a muscular list, even if it was a little bit less, maybe they do wall sorts of tests and drugs and everything else. Look at what's happened in swimming. Look at the records that are being broken. So how do you stop it? Do you go to the sports leagues? Do you go to the Olympic Games? You just ban it. The president ban's it. You just don't let it happen. That's it. Not a big deal. You have the next question. I know. Hi. My name is Rachel Schips. Or at Ship S. Rachel S. here from coming, Georgia. I'm a single mom to two kids here. And just in three and a half years, my child tax credit has decreased by 80%. Almost. Good one. For child tax credit. Okay. So it's decreased by 80%. That's, that's, that's, that's. Sorry. My child tax credit has decreased by almost 80%. Daycare for the lowest amount is roughly $1,400 a month for one child here. Yeah. Last year I broke my neck. I almost lost. You have a beautiful voice by the way. Thank you so much. I'm having a panic attack right now. No panic. No panic. Right here with you. But last year I had broken my neck and I tried applying for any kind of assistance and was denied because I did not make less than $700 a month. And I'm shaking like a freaking leaf I cannot stop. So I could not. A four day care I obviously was having to go through physical therapy and a lot of issues and I'm still having issues to this day. Right. I understand. But what kind of realistic change is that do you think you can provide single parents, married parents, any kind of parent to just simply afford children in today's world with the way things are? And it's not fair. Right? It is not fair. No. You never heard of Ivanka, right? Ivanka. My daughter drove me crazy on this. We had the simplest, most beautiful, you know, I give you the largest tax cuts in the history of our country, okay? Larger than the Reagan cuts larger. But my daughter, Ivanka, she said, did we have to do tax credits for, you know, for the child tax credits? She was driving me crazy. Then I did it and I got it just about done. Dad, you've got to double it up. I said, Ivanka, it was actually more complicated than the entire business. I can't believe I've got to go to a new bill, but I got it done. And what we're going to do, and I'm going to, because I understand exactly what you're saying, we're going to readjust things so that it's fair to everybody, because it's really not fair to everybody. But we have a lot, and we're going to, we're going up higher, but we're also going to readjust because you have to make some readjustments. It's unfair to some people, and we're not going to have that. But she was the one that got it started. You know, those were our credits. Those were not the Democrat credits. A lot of Republicans said, rightfully, don't do it because we never get credit for that. You know, we're not known for that. But the truth is, I wanted to put it all in the form of the tax cut. So I got the maximum tax cut, but we're also bringing down the taxes for companies and for people. We're bringing it down to 15%. And for companies, only if you make your product, build your product in the USA. Otherwise, you don't care. So we do care. Hey, everyone. I'm Emily Componio.

Kellyanne Conway: Trump has a chance to run the tables in November,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q,2024-10-16 09:30:02+00:00,Kamala Harris wins the popular vote?,0.6409785747528076," Here are three action, project 21, Chairman, Horace Cooper, former senior advisor of President Trump, Stephen Miller, Fox News contributor, Kellyanne Conway. All right, Kellyanne, three weeks from tonight, it is election night in America, it's game time. And where do you see the race right now? Donald Trump is winning, and he has an opportunity to have what I call a narrow landslide, meaning he can actually run the tables and win all seven swing states. He can win them narrowly, but they're winner-take-all because it's the electoral college Y. He's barnstorming and blitzing those swing states. He's going to the 22 counties or so where this race will be decided. And he feels confident enough in his running mate, J.D. Vance, to go have his own separate schedule. So they are double-teaming these swing states. And then Trump's doing smart things like going to iconic venues, Madison Square Garden, Coachella, California. Why is he there? Are the media asking those aren't swing states? Because he's Donald Trump, and he can fill up those venues and inspire people. The other thing that's going on is the left has no compelling message, no convincing persuasive messenger, and they have a lot of money. Money in politics is distortive. It makes the Harris campaign think that she doesn't have to be that good and she can still win. So what was started out, Sean, is penetrating the voters with ads has become, penetration has become, saturation is, and is on its way to inundation. That anger's the voters. They stop getting upset about the subject matter of your ads, and they start getting mad at the sponsor of the ads. Two quick statistics that tell the tale here. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, both one, 93% of the female black vote. Kamala Harris, a black woman, is at 71%. 18 to 40 feet of black men. Barack Obama had 81% in November of 2012. Kamala Harris has 41%. She has one half the number that Barack Obama had. So how does she make that up among non-collegated, educated households? Among white households that don't say abortion is her top one or two issue? How does she make that? She's bleeding out among union households, younger people. And I'm going to say blacks, Hispanics, and also Jewish voters. I'm mentioning to you groups that Donald Trump does not need to get anywhere near 50% to become the next president. I think he's in a great position to go right through far beyond 300 electoral votes. And the last thing I wanted to say is that registration numbers are incredible. Nevada and the North Carolina in Pennsylvania. The Republicans have really caught up the whole get out the voter education, early voting. All of those investments are paying off now. That's how you win this stuff. Technical, tactical trench warfare. Let me ask you, Horace, if I can. I think Kamala has been horrible in these interviews. And she wants to promise, you know, student loan forgiveness to those stupid 18 to 24-year-old kids that live in dormitories that she had talked about in the past. But now she wants to give $25,000 down payments. Now she's offering programs just to African-Americans. She's not doing well as Kelly Amos pointing out demographically with African-American men. So she sends out Barack Obama. That didn't work particularly well. He came off as somewhat condescending, accusing African-American men, perhaps would be in sexist in their thinking. And now she's offering all of these programs. Reparations, she will examine. She said earlier today, it didn't work out with Gretchen Whitmer. I mean, a huge controversy. Was she making fun or mocking Christians and Catholics? Obama didn't work out particularly well. Bill Clinton even went as far as to say that Lincoln Riley had we had vetting at the border would likely be alive today. I don't think that was particularly helpful. So I don't see that her surrogates are helping her that much either. Last year, my book came out, put you all back in chains, in which I predicted that Black America was sick and tired of the hoax plan. The latest hoax is apparently we're going to give a trillion plus dollars in payments calling it reparations. There is no scenario where some kind of grant of hundreds of thousands of dollars or a million dollars per person is ever actually going to happen. Black Americans have realized this and that is the reason why so many Black Americans are asking for basic answers. What are you going to do about inflation? What are you going to do about the crime problem? And what are you going to do about our country being overwhelmed by immigrants that are not supposed to be in this country taking school resources and other social services that actual American taxpayers have provided for? Disproportionately, these radical policies harm Black Americans. Now, I grew up in Texas where we have had the death penalty where we hold people accountable. My brother was a corrections officer on death row. We know first-hand that there must absolutely be accountability. What we're recently learning here looks like Willie Horton 2024. When you see a candidate advocating benefits like a sex change operation for a brutal killer, they ought to be already buried under the gel but apparently the progressive answer is just the opposite. Black Americans in particular, as well as most of America, find these radical policies not to their liking, not something that they can embrace in one last point. In 2020, Black Americans people often think Black Americans must be liberal because so many are registered as Democrats. Black Americans are moderates and centrist by and large and they picked Joe Biden because there were so many crazies that were running and there has been a huge level of disappointment that he ended up embracing all of the radical policies that Black America rejects. You know, Steven, you look at the insanity of this convicted murderer, sex change operation out in California, courtesy of taxpayer money, thanks to Kamal Harris. Then you look at a position on the border and you can look at a new green deal position, you can look at eliminating healthcare, you can look at mandatory gun buybacks, you can look at defund this mantle, no bail laws, but this one in particular, decriminalize illegal immigration, free food, housing, healthcare, education, you include Tim Walls, that would include college education, legal drivers licenses, sex change operations, and then a path to citizenship, earn path they call it, that would be called amnesty where I'm from. 12.5 million people, including members of drug cartels, gang members, we have Americans that have been murdered, raped, we have Americans victims of violent crime, it's costing the country billions of dollars, to people understand how bad this has gotten and what a national security threat this is, we have known terrorists now in the country, they know about them, but they don't know where they are, and now we're going to pay for sex change operations if they want them. Well, this is why Donald Trump is now leading in the polls, this is why Donald Trump is pulling ahead in this race because he's been going around the country, making all of these arguments, laying out all these facts, like you just said, he went to Aurora, Colorado, and gave a speech for the ages documenting in painstaking detail, how Kamala Harris imported a ruthless criminal syndicate from Venezuela into their community, taking over their parks, taking over their schools, taking over entire apartment complexes, as you mentioned, now we have this case, where a convicted murderer is getting a free taxpayer fund that's sex change operation, this is madness, this is beyond anything we've seen in the history of American politics, then she wants to give illegal aliens free housing, free welfare, free transportation, free everything, free education, free lifetime Medicare and Social Security retirement benefits, and of course, full voting and citizenship rights. And on top of all of that, one crime after another committed by this criminal migrants, including this new case of three illegals that she released, who sexually assaulted a 12-year-old. The amount of suffering and blood and misery on her hands is totally disqualifying. As Donald Trump has said, anyone who would lead an invasion of her own country cannot run to be president of that country. You add to it the Green New Deal, you add to it the largest proposed tax-hiking history, you add to it a pledge to massively increase regulations on every single sector of the economy, grinding growth to a halt, you have a full on communist that is running for president, who by the way also is pledged to abolish private health care and abolish fracking. America must and will reject this insanity. Do you think, I'll ask an exit question. Do you think it is now penetrated into the consciousness of the American people, how radical and extreme she is? 30 seconds each, starting with you, Kelli, yeah. Yes, and she made a big mistake, just not being part of the Biden-Harris agenda and saying the only change is really me, my age, my gender, my race, my generation. She's trying too hard to change her position because she knows this country is now looking for border security, doesn't want all these wars abroad once the economic prosperity, the Trump times. So Donald Trump has recast the Republican Party as the party, the worker, as the party of conservative values, as it's the party he said today of common sense, but he's having effect on the Democratic Party too. They're all running away from woke. You don't even recognize 2020 now. 2024, they're trying to sound more like Trump and the Republicans. Yeah, what do you think, Harris? What we're seeing is a clear and total rejection of these radical so-called progressive values. And you can see it, I believe, Black Americans are the canary in the coal mine. We are going to see the single largest in my lifetime rejection by Black Americans of a party that they've been affiliated with for my entire life. And it's precisely because these policies are so far out of the mainstream. Last word, Steve Miller. Yes, this is finally sinking in with the American people, is why you're receiving so much movement in the polls because President Trump's been out there every day in his podcast and his TV interviews and his radio interviews and his speeches, documenting all of these terrifying facts about her record. And that is why I believe you are going to see not just a record number of Black Americans that are going to be supporting Donald Trump, record minority support. And you're also going to see, as Kellyanne said, you're going to see massive victories across all the battlegrounds on election days. All right, we appreciate you all, Stephen. Thank you, Kellyanne.

Kellyanne Conway: Trump has a chance to run the tables in November,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yaqnE0MH6Q,2024-10-16 09:30:02+00:00,Trump gets more black voters than in 2020?,0.6170184016227722," Here are three action, project 21, Chairman, Horace Cooper, former senior advisor of President Trump, Stephen Miller, Fox News contributor, Kellyanne Conway. All right, Kellyanne, three weeks from tonight, it is election night in America, it's game time. And where do you see the race right now? Donald Trump is winning, and he has an opportunity to have what I call a narrow landslide, meaning he can actually run the tables and win all seven swing states. He can win them narrowly, but they're winner-take-all because it's the electoral college Y. He's barnstorming and blitzing those swing states. He's going to the 22 counties or so where this race will be decided. And he feels confident enough in his running mate, J.D. Vance, to go have his own separate schedule. So they are double-teaming these swing states. And then Trump's doing smart things like going to iconic venues, Madison Square Garden, Coachella, California. Why is he there? Are the media asking those aren't swing states? Because he's Donald Trump, and he can fill up those venues and inspire people. The other thing that's going on is the left has no compelling message, no convincing persuasive messenger, and they have a lot of money. Money in politics is distortive. It makes the Harris campaign think that she doesn't have to be that good and she can still win. So what was started out, Sean, is penetrating the voters with ads has become, penetration has become, saturation is, and is on its way to inundation. That anger's the voters. They stop getting upset about the subject matter of your ads, and they start getting mad at the sponsor of the ads. Two quick statistics that tell the tale here. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, both one, 93% of the female black vote. Kamala Harris, a black woman, is at 71%. 18 to 40 feet of black men. Barack Obama had 81% in November of 2012. Kamala Harris has 41%. She has one half the number that Barack Obama had. So how does she make that up among non-collegated, educated households? Among white households that don't say abortion is her top one or two issue? How does she make that? She's bleeding out among union households, younger people. And I'm going to say blacks, Hispanics, and also Jewish voters. I'm mentioning to you groups that Donald Trump does not need to get anywhere near 50% to become the next president. I think he's in a great position to go right through far beyond 300 electoral votes. And the last thing I wanted to say is that registration numbers are incredible. Nevada and the North Carolina in Pennsylvania. The Republicans have really caught up the whole get out the voter education, early voting. All of those investments are paying off now. That's how you win this stuff. Technical, tactical trench warfare. Let me ask you, Horace, if I can. I think Kamala has been horrible in these interviews. And she wants to promise, you know, student loan forgiveness to those stupid 18 to 24-year-old kids that live in dormitories that she had talked about in the past. But now she wants to give $25,000 down payments. Now she's offering programs just to African-Americans. She's not doing well as Kelly Amos pointing out demographically with African-American men. So she sends out Barack Obama. That didn't work particularly well. He came off as somewhat condescending, accusing African-American men, perhaps would be in sexist in their thinking. And now she's offering all of these programs. Reparations, she will examine. She said earlier today, it didn't work out with Gretchen Whitmer. I mean, a huge controversy. Was she making fun or mocking Christians and Catholics? Obama didn't work out particularly well. Bill Clinton even went as far as to say that Lincoln Riley had we had vetting at the border would likely be alive today. I don't think that was particularly helpful. So I don't see that her surrogates are helping her that much either. Last year, my book came out, put you all back in chains, in which I predicted that Black America was sick and tired of the hoax plan. The latest hoax is apparently we're going to give a trillion plus dollars in payments calling it reparations. There is no scenario where some kind of grant of hundreds of thousands of dollars or a million dollars per person is ever actually going to happen. Black Americans have realized this and that is the reason why so many Black Americans are asking for basic answers. What are you going to do about inflation? What are you going to do about the crime problem? And what are you going to do about our country being overwhelmed by immigrants that are not supposed to be in this country taking school resources and other social services that actual American taxpayers have provided for? Disproportionately, these radical policies harm Black Americans. Now, I grew up in Texas where we have had the death penalty where we hold people accountable. My brother was a corrections officer on death row. We know first-hand that there must absolutely be accountability. What we're recently learning here looks like Willie Horton 2024. When you see a candidate advocating benefits like a sex change operation for a brutal killer, they ought to be already buried under the gel but apparently the progressive answer is just the opposite. Black Americans in particular, as well as most of America, find these radical policies not to their liking, not something that they can embrace in one last point. In 2020, Black Americans people often think Black Americans must be liberal because so many are registered as Democrats. Black Americans are moderates and centrist by and large and they picked Joe Biden because there were so many crazies that were running and there has been a huge level of disappointment that he ended up embracing all of the radical policies that Black America rejects. You know, Steven, you look at the insanity of this convicted murderer, sex change operation out in California, courtesy of taxpayer money, thanks to Kamal Harris. Then you look at a position on the border and you can look at a new green deal position, you can look at eliminating healthcare, you can look at mandatory gun buybacks, you can look at defund this mantle, no bail laws, but this one in particular, decriminalize illegal immigration, free food, housing, healthcare, education, you include Tim Walls, that would include college education, legal drivers licenses, sex change operations, and then a path to citizenship, earn path they call it, that would be called amnesty where I'm from. 12.5 million people, including members of drug cartels, gang members, we have Americans that have been murdered, raped, we have Americans victims of violent crime, it's costing the country billions of dollars, to people understand how bad this has gotten and what a national security threat this is, we have known terrorists now in the country, they know about them, but they don't know where they are, and now we're going to pay for sex change operations if they want them. Well, this is why Donald Trump is now leading in the polls, this is why Donald Trump is pulling ahead in this race because he's been going around the country, making all of these arguments, laying out all these facts, like you just said, he went to Aurora, Colorado, and gave a speech for the ages documenting in painstaking detail, how Kamala Harris imported a ruthless criminal syndicate from Venezuela into their community, taking over their parks, taking over their schools, taking over entire apartment complexes, as you mentioned, now we have this case, where a convicted murderer is getting a free taxpayer fund that's sex change operation, this is madness, this is beyond anything we've seen in the history of American politics, then she wants to give illegal aliens free housing, free welfare, free transportation, free everything, free education, free lifetime Medicare and Social Security retirement benefits, and of course, full voting and citizenship rights. And on top of all of that, one crime after another committed by this criminal migrants, including this new case of three illegals that she released, who sexually assaulted a 12-year-old. The amount of suffering and blood and misery on her hands is totally disqualifying. As Donald Trump has said, anyone who would lead an invasion of her own country cannot run to be president of that country. You add to it the Green New Deal, you add to it the largest proposed tax-hiking history, you add to it a pledge to massively increase regulations on every single sector of the economy, grinding growth to a halt, you have a full on communist that is running for president, who by the way also is pledged to abolish private health care and abolish fracking. America must and will reject this insanity. Do you think, I'll ask an exit question. Do you think it is now penetrated into the consciousness of the American people, how radical and extreme she is? 30 seconds each, starting with you, Kelli, yeah. Yes, and she made a big mistake, just not being part of the Biden-Harris agenda and saying the only change is really me, my age, my gender, my race, my generation. She's trying too hard to change her position because she knows this country is now looking for border security, doesn't want all these wars abroad once the economic prosperity, the Trump times. So Donald Trump has recast the Republican Party as the party, the worker, as the party of conservative values, as it's the party he said today of common sense, but he's having effect on the Democratic Party too. They're all running away from woke. You don't even recognize 2020 now. 2024, they're trying to sound more like Trump and the Republicans. Yeah, what do you think, Harris? What we're seeing is a clear and total rejection of these radical so-called progressive values. And you can see it, I believe, Black Americans are the canary in the coal mine. We are going to see the single largest in my lifetime rejection by Black Americans of a party that they've been affiliated with for my entire life. And it's precisely because these policies are so far out of the mainstream. Last word, Steve Miller. Yes, this is finally sinking in with the American people, is why you're receiving so much movement in the polls because President Trump's been out there every day in his podcast and his TV interviews and his radio interviews and his speeches, documenting all of these terrifying facts about her record. And that is why I believe you are going to see not just a record number of Black Americans that are going to be supporting Donald Trump, record minority support. And you're also going to see, as Kellyanne said, you're going to see massive victories across all the battlegrounds on election days. All right, we appreciate you all, Stephen. Thank you, Kellyanne. Thank you, and Harris. Always good to see you as well. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News YouTube page. And catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis.

Barack sent Kamala Harris to see 'Tha God': Watters,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyMQ7NNrhao,2024-10-16 01:45:02+00:00,"Will Kamala say ""Black men"" during Fox News interview?",0.6599881649017334," As Barack Obama said, Kamala Harris has an issue with the brothers. You texted me right around the Democratic Convention and you said, I am talking to people in Kamala Harris has a problem with Black men. Yeah, and I told the campaign I did not hear from them. I mean, who am I for them to get back to me? But there's a problem. I went up to people just doing man on the street. It's who you're going to vote for, Black men and time after time after time. They said, I'm voting for Donald Trump. Kamala was supposed to be the pantsuit Messiah, but she's really more of an actress. When he was asked about what he was going to do, he says he's got concepts of a plan for how he'd replace it. He has no plan to replace it. You guys watched the debate. Right, he has quote concepts of a plan. Concepts. Kamala is imitating Barack, but there's one problem. She's more like Hillary and the streets know it. There's nothing about the poll numbers that we're seeing right now. That shouldn't make anybody feel like she got this and remember those poll numbers with Hillary. Remember those poll numbers are Hillary and I keep telling people this campaign feels more Hillary-ish than it does. Obama-ish Obama-Oedis. When Hillary was in trouble with the Black vote, Democrats closed their eyes and prayed for the God to savor that Charlemagne the God. But then Hillary pulled out the hot sauce. What's something that you always carry with you? Hot sauce. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Really? Are you getting the information right now? Hot sauce in my bag, Swag? Hot sauce. Really? Yeah. Now listen, I just want you to know, people are going to see this saying, okay, she's panicking. Black people. Okay. Is it working? Okay. No, seriously. Hot sauce. I've been eating a lot of hot sauce. A lot of raw peppers and hot sauce. Then Democrats tried it again. They sent Biden in and he told him, you ain't black. There's a long way until November. We got more questions. You got more questions. If I tell you, if you have a problem, figure it out whether you're from mere Trump and you ain't black. Oh. So Baroque sent Harris to see the God, hoping the third time to charm. Harris spent all day prepping for Charlemagne, cleared her whole schedule for one interview at five o'clock. The first question, Charlemagne, asked her, do you ever say anything new? Well, what do you say to people who say you stay on the talking points? I would say you're welcome. Mm-hmm. I mean, listen, here's the thing. I love having conversations, which is why I'm so happy to be with you this afternoon. And the reality is that there are certain things that must be repeated to ensure that I have everyone know what I stand for and the issues that I think are at stake in this election. And so it requires repetition. You know, some people say that until someone has heard the same thing at least three times, it just doesn't stay with you. So repetition is important. Commit the things voters are too ignorant to get her message through their thick skulls. She has to repeat it like a hypnotist. And it's not even working because no one ever knows what she's talking about. This was kind of a virtual town hall with voters who called in and they wanted to know where's my money you promised? My question to you is, what's your stance on reparations? I do have clear eyes about the disparities that exist and the context in which they exist, meaning history to your point. So my agenda, well, first of all, on the point of reparations, it has to be studied. There's no question about that. As it relates to the economy, which is a lot of what you have addressed. Look, I grew up in the middle class. My mother, you know, worked hard, raised me in my sister. And by the time I was in high school, she was able to afford our first home. I know what it means for an individual and a family to have home ownership. Translation, you're not getting reparations. I want to give you reparations, but they told me I can't say that. What I can say is that I grew up in the middle class. Black men have been asking, how are you going to make my life better? Because my life was better under Trump. So, Kamala, after four years of doing nothing, just came out with a plan for black men. Legalize weed and $20,000 welfare checks. That's right. Kamala wants to win the black vote with free money and drugs, but protecting black jobs is offensive, okay? Even black voters are a little suspicious. I read that there is a new opportunity agenda, a plan for black men, which includes a proposal of forgivable loans up to $20,000 for one million black entrepreneurs. What would you say to the people that will consider the timing of this proposal as political timing? I've been in this race about 70 days. You can look at all my work before those 70 days to know that this what I'm talking about right now is not new and is not for the sake of winning this election. This is about a longstanding commitment, including the work that I've done as vice president and before when I was senator and before that. Kamala has been in power for four years. Before that, she was a senator. Never proposed this before and three weeks before the election after struggling with the black vote. Here's a check for $20 grand and a blunt. Did Kamala even come up with this pitch or did her white handlers sit around thinking, hmm, black people love handouts and getting high. Let's give this a shot. Democrats have been in charge of the White House for 12 of the last 16 years and black Americans feel like they haven't done anything. One voter told the New York Times that they elected the first black president and were still in the same place. Blacks are bailing on Democrats because of their policies, but Democrats are trying to reel them in with identity politics. As it goes to black men, yes, we were out making the case that we have historically low unemployment, but we need to do more. Our message is solid. It's the right one for folks. And I think at the end of the day, they come back home. Walls is guaranteeing it. They'll come back home. They always come back home. Who talks like that about people? They don't even try to earn the black vote. They scold, bribe, try to smoke them up. And if you don't come back home quick, they're going to send Don Lemon to chase you down. Tough conversations are just that tough. And people don't want to hear them. Sometimes people need to be chastised, right? You don't want your message to bounce off. I don't think that all the blame should be put on black men, but the black men that I have spoken to, and I continue to speak to on a daily basis come up with these excuses and these reasons that are just inaccurate, are just plain wrong. There are three excuses. One is misinformation, right? Two is the media ecosystem, what media you're consuming. And three is that perhaps you are just, perhaps you are a misogynist. Barak gave the media the green light to rough up black voters. Don Lemon is coming in hot with an open hand. He has appointed himself the black vote enforcer. You can do this the easy way or the hard way. And Lemon prefers the hard way. MSNBC is bringing out the heavy guns. Joy Reid is going to snatch you up by the throat. And if you don't vote Democrat, you ain't black, you're sexist, and you're a fascist. Have you noticed how sharply the polls have shifted in Trump's favor over the last couple weeks? With these claims that Trump is surging with black and Latino voters and leading in every single swing state, according to secret internal polls, despite all the Hitler talk. Yes, this race will be far too close. Because unfortunately, we do have a fascist groundswell in parts of this country. Mainly among white men, let's be clear, but in small pockets, among black and brown men too. This happens to be a global phenomenon, as women become more economically independent and seek positions of power. Oh my God. All right. So fascist, sexist, race trader, what else are we missing here? This election is going to be no different. They've already started with the misinformation and the lies. We know that there is foreign interference and I have to say to everybody listening to this. Don't let them take your voice. Because I was part of the Senate Intelligence Committee when we investigated Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Black folks were targeted with misinformation. Ah, black men are sexist, fascist, Russian puppets. Got it. But white dudes for Harris, they're sexy. Don't you want to be sexy? And when all else fails, you go to old faithful. Scarom back home. They can't stop blacks from voting anymore, the way they did in the 60s, with the same kind of success. What they want to do is they want to win the election night until the inauguration. And if they can go in and they can violently disrupt these counting centers, how will states be able to certify elections? He burned down a county center in Arizona. How does the governor certify those elections? What world are we in then? Democrats know their party can't function when people or groups think or act independently. The machine is designed to enforce blind loyalty and unquestioning faith. Persuasion, not part of the equation. Your edict is, you're either with us 100% or we're going to make your life miserable. You swallow every hoax, follow every order, lie for us and nod your head, yes. Anything besides that, you have to go see Don and Joy in the dungeon. The Wall Street Journal frames Kamala's pitch to black voters as you're either a bad person or you're just stupid. Quote, are you an immoral, bigoted person? One of those notoriously misogynistic black men who can't stand up at you women or a white racist or hates foreigners or are you a dupe easily misled by misinformation? When you don't like liberal ideas because you've seen the results, Democrats don't try to get better results. They just hate you for pointing out their failing. Loyal Democrats are supposed to pretend not to notice. Everyone else gets ridiculed into submission in 2008. Obama called rural America bitter clingers. In 16, Hillary called him a basket of deplorables. In 2020, Biden called you a threat to democracy. And now Democrats are calling their own voters who they think they own sexist Russian plans. But here's the catch. The media is amplifying the Democrats attacking their own side. Democrats expect to be criticized by Republicans, but not by other Democrats. It's things, especially after the Democrats have done very little for Black America in the last decade, adding insult to injury. When the machine loses control, it can't operate. Everything needs to be clicking on all cylinders. It's not. Biden should have lost the election honorably. And the machine would have been able to regroup for the next cycle. But Democrats can accept not being in power. And therefore, they had the coup and the Kamala coronation. Both acts of desperation have exposed the party's dark underbelly for the whole country to see. And is turning off more Democrats, more than any Biden loss would have.

Laura: Democrats are 'spinning' over this,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xbPQfc-6XY,2024-10-16 01:15:00+00:00,Kamala Harris wins the popular vote?,0.6120073795318604," Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. This is the Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. As always, thank you for joining us. Kamala's demeaning pitch to black men. That's the focus of tonight's angle. A five-point plan, including weed and money, is how Kamala thinks she's going to win over the black voters that she's losing. But they're smarter than she thinks they are. What would you say to the people that will consider the timing of this proposal as political timing? So first of all, thank you for your question. If you're being here, I've been in this race about 70 days. You can look at all my work before those 70 days to know that this what I'm talking about right now is not new and is not for the sake of winning this election. Oh, okay. Now many years ago, when I clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas, I learned that there is nothing that bothers liberals. I mean, really bothers them. Bathers them more than minorities who think for themselves. And that means right now they are spinning over new data coming out about black views on Trump versus Harris. In the bottom line is this. At this particular hour, if you believe the polling, Donald Trump's going to put up the best performance with black voters since Richard Nixon back in 1960, not 68 since 1960. That's 64 years ago. Now, he still only gets 15% or so the black vote according to the New York Times poll, but that's a 67% improving of the support he got in 2020. And it's double what he got in 2016. That's called progress. But rather than try to figure out what Trump is saying, what he did previously that resonates, Kamala Harris recites lines written for her by her consultants. Nothing substantive just trash talk. Look at it in the context of how he actually thinks and talks about black folks in America. This man is dangerous. Not to mention Rowland. Let's fast forward to right now. He, his staff won't let him do a 60 minutes interview. Now, hold the laughter. This from a woman who hid for most of the campaign and still hasn't held a press conference. Nice try. Now, according to Fox News power rankings, Kamala's declined among men, Hispanics, and black voters, especially could be decisive factors in states like Pennsylvania and Arizona. Now, that's why Obama embarrassed himself last week, lecturing black, man, that's still my favorite thing of all last week about how if they don't vote for Kamala, they'll be considered essentially just a bunch of idiot sexists. Well, that backfired big time. He also threatened to bring Michelle to lecture them. So how does Kamala win back black men? Now, with a serious plan, I imagine, to ditch by dynamics and grow the economy. So black men have the jobs that they deserve, or perhaps with a pledge to seal the border once and for all. No, of course not. Instead, she's dangling goodies that she knows she could never deliver on. She went on with Charlemagne the God this afternoon. I do have clear eyes about the disparities that exist and the context in which they exist, meaning history. On the point of reparations, it has to be studied. There's no question about that. But wait, there's more. She says she's going to fight for one million forgivable loans to black entrepreneurs. Now, aside from the fact that that's totally unconstitutional, of course, that's never stopped them before. And if none of that works, she hopes that they're going to feel better about the crappy economy and dangerous streets. If they at least know they can smoke weed and not be thrown in federal prison. What public defenders who around those days will tell you, I was the most progressive prosecutor in California on marijuana cases. And as vice president, have been a champion for bringing marijuana down on the schedule. So instead of it being ranked up there with heroin, we bring it down. And my pledge is as president, I will work on decriminalizing it because I know exactly how those laws have been used to disproportionately impact certain populations and specifically black men. Well, then Sherry, do that when she was a prosecutor, this she already throw a bunch of people in jail for weed. Well, she also added on her campaign website, the typical gibberish about equity and price gouging on food and groceries. Yeah, that's the same recycled proposal that has been roundly ridiculed even by Democrat economists. So this all smacks of unseriousness and frankly desperation. Now Obama again acted like black men were misogynists for not supporting Kamala. And now Kamala is treating black men like they're too stupid to recognize a con artist when they see one.

I love the idea of Kamala Harris on Joe Rogans podcast: Judge Jeanine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlbJXw2n0Bs,2024-10-15 23:45:01+00:00,Will Kamala go on Lex Fridman podcast?,0.6422330141067505," a podcast enthusiast, I use it for, I listen a lot and I think this is a pretty good development for everybody like the more the better though, what does Kamala have to do to try to change the race? She's gonna come on Fox tomorrow night with Brett Bares. So Judge, what do you think? Well, first of all, I love the idea of her going on, Joe Rogan because I mean, on his podcast, like a couple of hours to three hours, I mean, what makes anyone think she could get through two to three hours without repeating herself over and over again? But I think it's almost a recognition that they realize that everything is trending against them. They've got nothing to lose at this point. Remember Joe Rogan and their Trump talked about going on Rogan first and I think this is Kamala kind of following up. But Joe Rogan is, he's got a big male audience, so that's a smart move. And also he's a big time supporter of RFK who's into health and into, you know, all of these issues about, you know, whether it's vaccine, but it's also the FDA and all that. Fairies. And I think that in the end, it's smart if she can do it. If she can't do it, I mean, it can put, you know, it can finish her. It's very different from the view. The view of everybody, oh, you're wonderful, you're wonderful. Joe Rogan is totally different. Yeah. And also on the view, you have a studio audience cheering you on. And that's not the case when you're one-on-one by yourself, Harold, what do you think? So I agree with the judge. This is going to be a great test. I think we have rightly so, as I said at the one in our earlier segment, been critical of some of the things she has not done. The fact that she's doing this, I think, is a great, a great thing for the race and a great thing for those who listen. I don't listen to a lot of these podcasts. I'm going to have to listen to one or two of these, get a chance to hear what she's saying. But in the 90 minutes, she got up on stage. I think she beat President Trump in that debate. So maybe 30 minutes longer, she may not do as well. We'll see. President Trump has gained, listening to him, and I like him personally. I listen to him, though, and the name calling's got to stop. Like, I think one of the things, if I were in his campaign, I can't imagine that the Haley supporters in some of these key critical states find that appealing. You're trying to appeal to such a small group of voters at this moment, including Vice President Harris, as she thinks about this. You got to think about Long and Hard. What are you saying to convince that group to come to you at the very end here in these six or seven states? I'm not sure that the name calling, calling, I think Jimmy Kemp is not a loser, but calling Jimmy Kemp a loser is that the right thing. Finally, there was one last thing in that, what you call the E-cock economic club of Chicago. President Trump was asked by, I think it was a Bloomberg, editor news and chief. President Trump had talked about how world leaders respect him, he talked about President Premonist Netanyahu, President Orban, and President Zelensky. And then the guy asked, and we'll have you spoken with President Putin since you left office. And he said, I'm not going to answer that question. I keep some things from him. He said, well, you just talked about the things you talked about with the other people, these other leaders. So that, I think is President Trump thinks about these things, and he thinks about these last three weeks, I'm just trying to give balls and strikes, call them and give advice. I think Long and Hard about how you present that here in the last few weeks. Greg, I think we're going to talk a little bit about this issue in the next block. But I think if President Trump were to go on Riley Gaines' podcast to talk about protecting women's sports, that could get a lot of news. Yeah, and it's the one area that Kamla has skated by, which is what is a woman. I can't wait to hear somebody prepare. Ask her what is a woman? Because she promoted the sex change of a double murderer, a guy who murdered a couple to get a sex change. And he got it. And the California taxpayers are paying for it. You know what Rogan is to Kamla Harris? He's the next-door neighbor who supports Trump, but he has a swimming pool you really want to use. And boy, it's hot out, and she needs that swimming pool, because she's drowning. That's a mixed metaphor, it doesn't really work. This is the first time, though, that she's getting outside of her padded cell. And she's like one of those patients that live in a plastic bubble. Remember the boy in the plastic bubble with John Travolta, classic film? She lacks the immune system. She lacks the immune system to go outside, to survive in reality. Meanwhile, Trump, he can sit with Rogan for four hours, because this whole life has been nothing but casual and intense interactions, which is built up as a immune system. Her media coddling has afforded her no immune system, and that's why you see her repeating things a lot. She just hasn't been pushed. She doesn't push herself. If you're still a dude, and you say you're thinking about voting for Kamla, we know what you're saying. You're either voting for Trump, or you're not voting. Because a dude isn't going to get up and go out of his way alone to go vote for that. He's going to have to be dragged by his wife or his girlfriend. She's taking him to the Lilith Fair, because no guy goes to the Lilith Fair on their own. No guy goes to a craft shop on their own. Harold's. Harold. Is that true? So I'll tell you this. Well, the dudes cannot vote for Kamla and feel like a dude, because she's soaped. And Harold, you know this. We talked about this in the green room. You're only doing this for a bunch of guy friends who have daughters and sons who are of age voting. And they share with me that they were Republican. They voted for President Trump in 16, something vote for him in 20. And they said they can't do it because they can't tell their kids something that they can't lie to their kids. So they're going to vote for Kamla Harris. I'm just saying, I've heard you were a Republican friends that are voting for Kamla. Why? Why do you do not vote for Kamla Harris? What's the biggest lie you've ever told when they... What would make you laugh at that? Oh, sense. I wouldn't make it. What would make you laugh at that? Let's get him on the bar. Yeah, get him on the bar. We'll call him after this show. I don't believe that. We'll call him after this show. I just wanted to mention one thing, Jesse. So on some of these policy podcasts, or some of the podcasts, they've gotten deep into policy. Like on Theo Vaughan's podcast, Trump was talking about health care transparency. But then I can't remember the name of the guys. He was almost some comedians. And he told the story about how he got mad at Don Jr. for bringing home too many kids for a party. Yeah, that's Andrew Schultz's podcast. Okay. It's like one of those things where if you can pull it off, they can work well for you. Usually the best podcasts guests are an expert in a field. They can go deep. A comedian who can just be entertaining the whole time or a great storyteller. Kamla Harris is none of those things. And Rogan is not a conservative. He's more of an independent. And so he's not going to go out and throttler. But what he will do is he will ask basic follow-up questions. Like, well, what did you mean by that? Right. Yeah. Or will tell me how that's going to work. And also because he's got time, he doesn't have to jump ahead. And that's the thing. Time. They're going to limit the time to under an hour because they're scared of the follow-up question, right? Yeah. ahead. We just got brand new sound from Kamla's interview.

Bret Baier reveals strategy for highly-anticipated Harris interview,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ0eEpWsLYQ,2024-10-15 15:15:00+00:00,Kamala Harris and JD Vance debate before election?,0.6094149351119995," Tossup is yellow in case you're wondering. Rain more on this, plus a report anchor, Brett Baer. So this morning, I was listening to podcasts at New York Times does, and they choose three or four stories to highlight in a morning. Your interview with Kamala Harris was one of those three. So this is big news to everybody. People are getting a lot of, there's a lot of interest in it. And I'm curious if you could walk us through, how did it come together, and then how do you think it will go? How much time do you get with her? Yeah, good morning. You listened to a lot of those podcasts. I do. I'm an enthusiast. It keeps me sharp. Yeah, it took a long time. The back and forth of the campaign. I'd obviously asked a lot of us have for interviews. I was also asking about a debate that we were trying to have a final closing arguments. The campaign came back and said she was going to have this event in Philadelphia, and I could have a sit down. So the time is roughly 25 minutes. 25 to 30 minutes. We were trying to do it live, but they gave us the time, 5 p.m. Eastern time, as you know, my show starts at 6. So we're doing it pre-taped, but wanted to wait until we got the commercial structure. So now we do, thanks to the folks above, we are going to run it uninterrupted, unedited all the way. Maybe 30 minutes, the first part of a special report, and then we'll have a panel discussion about it afterwards. So that's how it came about. It's been a long time in the making, and I'm in the making of how it's going to be structured. Yeah, I'm curious to know how she got to, yes. Before I let you answer that, I don't want to just read this headline for the New York Times today, because this is what we woke up to. Harris's final challenge was to restore a splintering democratic coalition. Defection from black and Latino voters and making Kamala Harris more dependent on white suburban voters and complicating her path to victory. So why would she see this massive audience as an opportunity, or who does she see in that audience? Well, I just think that, you know, you're right. We have a lot of eyeballs. We have Democrats, Independents, and Republicans. We have the biggest cable news audience. And this probably is going to get a lot more eyeballs. I think tough but fair is what I pitched it as, and I think that's what they're going to see. If you can think of the issues that people care about, that they ask pollster, are they answered to pollsters, what they care about, those questions are going to be in the mix. And, you know, some things that perhaps haven't been asked in other interviews, there's time. You know, 30 minutes is enough time to press and follow up. And I think we'll go down a number of different roads. That event outside Philadelphia is a Republicans supporting Harris. So I think she's using that event to kind of make a point before the interview. David Plough, who was with Obama now, is with the Colmar Harris campaign. He told New York Magazine, this is going to be close. And this one may be close in more states than we've seen in a long time. We have six, seven states come down to a point, point and a half. It's call for number five, guys. And that's probably where this is headed. And then if you just look at the Fox News power rankings forecast map, we just put Michigan as a toss up that had been lean Democrat. And then you look at these ABC and NBC polls with Harris 5048 and Harris Trump 4848. It is, I heard yesterday it described as it's tied and getting closer. Yeah, exactly. And, you know, if you believe these polls and there's a slew of them, it's all within the margin of error. And it comes down to those seven states. So in these final three weeks, it's hard to believe. We were three weeks from the day. Any little thing that moves the needle any bit could be a factor. So these events are big things. Harris is town hall with the former president. It's going to be a big thing tomorrow. And we've invited the former president for the same format of this interview, uninterrupted 30 minutes. And we'll see if he takes us up on it before the election. Well, maybe you have Harris on Wednesday and Trump on Thursday. That'd be a good week. And she wanted to be on it at 5 o'clock. I'm sure we could accommodate on the five. Okay. A little roundtable question. Sure, why not? Let's go. I'd always be fearful of Greg. Never fear the Greg. Hey, Greg, good luck. We'll talk to you soon. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. All right. I'm Steve Doosie. I'm Brian Kilme. And I'm meansly Earhart.

Kamala Harris thinks Trump is hiding?: Gutfeld,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UqS4EI1Yxo,2024-10-15 13:45:00+00:00,Trump flips Kamala on 538 before election?,0.6169822812080383," I would say hold your applause, but I like it. So why would I say that? Kamala calls out Donald Trump after covering Biden's declining rump. On Sunday in North Carolina, Kamala airs attacked Donald Trump, accusing him of hiding in these final days of the campaign or roll its ven. The week and unstable to lead America. Alright. Maybe Zena, Queen of Xanax has a point. Two week and unstable to lead. The guy was shot in the head. Any f***ing godbag up. Kamala should know what Kamala should know a two week and unstable looks like by now. Joe Biden ring any bells. Firstly, Joe has already forgotten who she is or who he is. So Kamala's demanding Trump's medical records. Meanwhile, Joe's demanding help getting all those knives out of his back. Morgan. Is this pretty ballsy or does she have brain damage? Uh, yes. It's just so, it's like funny. Is somebody who worked for Trump? The number one request I got from people is, can you please tell them not to tweet those or not to say this? It's like there's no stopping this guy from being in the public light. He's like selling out Coachella more than a lot of major bands would. He's coming to New York. He's all over the country. He's doing every interview, every podcast. JD Vance is on like every single Sunday show. She's yet to do press conference. Oh, and she covered up for basically an infirm president for four years. So, you know, I don't know. She's no leg to stand on. She has no legs, Joe. I'm not sure about that. She has legs to stand on, but that's about it, Greg. She gives less press conferences than punk's tiny fill. She's the one that's hiding. Look, Eric, Kamla is clearly trying to go Trump in another debate. She's very transparent about that. And that's the only time she's transparent, because you can see right through her. So, Kat, do you think she's just going to give him a debate? Politics is so funny because like, how could you do that? You know, how could you go out there and be like, he's old and, you know, he's hiding when you're dude that you, he ran the entire last campaign from a basement. Yeah. I don't understand how you can say that with a straight face. I really don't understand how you can say that with a straight face. But I think most people know that, right? But the only reason most people might not realize that there's only one reason is because nobody thinks about Joe Biden at all anymore. Yes, he's already forgotten. He's still the president, you guys. Just FYI. Right now, he is the president of the United States. Yes. It's very easy to forget that. Yeah, he's like the cheap motel and the rear view mirror. That's just getting smaller and smaller and she's just assuming you've forgotten it. But where is he now? Tell me about hiding. Like, wha? He's still the president. Yeah. No, it's, you know, no one thinks of it. I still do Joe Biden videos every day. Greg just won't air them. Well, you should put on some clothes. I think you've taken working at home a little too far. But it's also you can only pull off that thing what she did, Tom. If you safely assume the media is not going to call you on it, we're probably the only people that are calling are on this hypocrisy. I doubt MSNBC. MSNBC, CNN is probably laughing at her, you know, yeah, and I don't know what the, I don't know what the plan is. Like obviously she didn't think of that. Her staff said, oh, now let's go after him and say he's hiding. When he's out every day, the guy doesn't stop doing rallies. He exhausts me. Yeah. I mean, I don't know how he has the energy to do it. And so it doesn't seem like a very good line of attack. I think the thing about the medical records is the funniest thing because we've been through all that. He should definitely have his doctor come out. Ronnie Jackson has a lot of energy and he should just come out and make everything. Like you said, with the, you know, the assassination attempt, that should be the medical report. He should reference everything. He should come out and be like, the president, we've checked his blood, which we tested when it came out of his ear after he was shot. Yeah. His blood pressure is normal, except for that one time he pumped his fist in the ear and yelled, fight, fight, fight after being shot. His hearing's good. Both ears, both the one that was shot. And the one that wasn't shot. That's an excellent point. I hope they're watching. Okay. Up next, Vance makes the case and puts a host in her place. Hey, Sean Hannity here.

Netanyahu reveals plans for strike on Iran,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YROnmSNGpzY,2024-10-15 11:30:30+00:00,Israel strike on Iranian nuclear facility in 2024?,0.6989579200744629," This is a Fox News Alert, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly telling President Biden he is willing to strike Iran's military rather than oil or nuclear facilities as tensions are rising in the Middle East. Matt Fenn joins us live from Tel Aviv. Matt? And you may recall about two weeks ago now when Iran launched roughly 200 missiles here into Israel. Fox aired it live really a horrifying moment. Well, since then, the world has been waiting to see how Israel will respond. The concern is that if Israel is too aggressive, the shadow war between Iran and Israel could become a full-blown confrontation. Well, now we have some insight into Israel's plan. The Washington Post reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told President Biden in a phone call that Israel will strike Iranian military sites instead of oil or nuclear locations. That information signals Netanyahu might be willing to avoid greater escalation with Iran at least for now. And he's aware that any type of strike against Iran could actually impact our U.S. elections. Netanyahu reportedly saying, we will listen to the opinions of the United States, but we will make our final decisions based on our national interests. Also happening today here in the Middle East, we expect the United States anti-missile system called THAD for short to arrive here in Israel. A THAD battery, as it's called, is manufactured by Lockheed Martin. It's a billion dollar defense system against missiles.

Sean Hannity: The panic on the left is palpable,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Q2TB1nD2s,2024-10-15 02:30:29+00:00,Will Kamala Harris drop out of presidential race?,0.6224955320358276," Welcome to Hannity and tonight we are only 22 days away from the election. The panic on the left is palpable. The poll numbers are not good for Kamala Harris. However, I urge every voter to assume that your soul vote will decide this election. In other words, take nothing for granted. But now in a last-ditch effort to win over voters, the Harris campaign is getting very interesting. We're trying out two very desperate measures. One, the first, includes more public events for the Democratic candidate who has been in hiding for 84 days. And as you can imagine, it is not going well at all. Take a look. You know, there's this whole, I talked with somebody once who said, you know, if you just look at where the stars are in the sky, don't look them as just random things if you just look at them as points. Look at the constellation. What does it show you? So you just outlined it, Roland. What does it show you? That the cities that he picks on in terms of black population or black mayor are both. Stars and the sky. Beautiful. Let's state the obvious. Kamala Harris is a terrible candidate. Her running mate, well, it's just as bad if not worse. She does not connect with voters, especially without a teleprompter. That is why Kamala has been in hiding. That is why her surrogates are so important to her campaign. Now, this brings us to the second desperate measure that the Harris campaign is now employing here a full-core press featuring all of Kamala Harris's top allies. But so far, that strategy has been a disaster. First, campaign co-chair, Gretchen Whitmer. She had to finally apologize for that bizarre video that many believe was a cheap attempt at mocking holy communion. Take a look. And then Whitmer spent the next several days claiming, no, this was merely a promotion for semi-conductor chips. And now has finally been forced to apologize for offending Catholics and other Christians. And at the same time, another Harris surrogate Barack Obama. It looked like he really wanted to be in Pennsylvania before the speech. He only seemed to enjoy bashing Trump, which is the left's obsession. And there, he was scolding African-American men, even accusing them of sexism. Listen. We have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all forms of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running. Now, I also want to say that that seems to be more pronounced with the brothers. And I'm speaking to men directly. Pardon it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president. And you're coming up with alternatives and other reasons for that. Oh, maybe you're against women. Wow. Those condescending remarks will not receive well at all. Far-left activists, Nina Turner, even accused Obama of, quote, blaming black men for the Democratic Party's failures. The very liberal, New York magazine, calling it, quote, Barack Obama's tiresome condescension towards black men. An op-ed in the Washington Post referred to Obama as the Skolder in Chief and advised the Harris campaign to, quote, steer clear of Obama's instinct for, quote, tough love. So after a heavy dose of judgment from the former president, in this case, Obama, well, Harris campaign continues with more surrogates, but equally insulting tactics. Harris is now promising, you know, a handout and cold hard cash up to 20 grand, in forgivable loan forgiveness, loans that are only available to black entrepreneurs, that they would be the only ones able or eligible to receive it. She, remember, also wants to pay off student loans, and she's vowing to help African Americans invest in cryptocurrency, and she's calling for marijuana to be legalized. But when you, you know, think of the pandering, and you think you can't get any worse, you know, well, think back. She wants to, is this kind of like a vote, buying scheme when you want to pay off student loans for young people that you call stupid, or is it $25,000 down payment to your first home, or $50,000 for other businesses, or what about her running mate, Tim Walls trying to win over male voters with sports and guns, because on Friday during a quick trip to a high school football game, you know, where Walls was a assistant volunteer coach, that kind of claimed he was the coach, was he was almost ignored by the entire crowd. He gave him the silent treatment, and then on Saturday, Walls, he wanted to, you know, show the world what a big second amendment guy he was, and he brought out a shotgun, and he went fesant hunting. And meanwhile, Kamala, she wants mandatory gun buyback. Some might call a confiscation. Unfortunately, this was also a disaster for Walls. He didn't seem to know how to load his own gun. You decide. That fight during, and it never fits quite right. You know, it's not quite right. How do you give it back? Governor, what kind of gun is this? This is a Burreta A400. I bought it when I was shooting a lot of trap, because it has a kind of their patented thing that kick off, so when you get old, it doesn't hurt your shoulders much. It's probably been 15 years since I pulled that sucker out. Anyway, of course, this trip wasn't all about guns and hunting. Walls also trying to connect with this fellow guy, you know, pounding down a diet mountain do. I prefer regular. Take a look. Don't get in. That's it. Well, it's hunting, not shooting, right? You knew it, didn't you, man. And I'm going to grab a diet mountain do if we got one, and I'm going to pound one down. I think that Walls is bad. Just waiting to hear about the next campaign's surrogate. Can't make this up either. In another desperate attempt to win over men, the Harris campaign turned to Bill Clinton. How you doing? Good to see you. Slick, Willie, I'm back. I'm all by myself. Hillary's on vacation. Unfortunately, Slick, Willie, is not as slick as he used to be. And today, when trying to blame Trump for the border crisis, which was secure when they inherited it, and they bragged about for three years, the border being closed, the border being secure, and bragging about undoing all the Trump border policies that brought us the lowest level of illegal immigration in decades. Bill Clinton, unfortunately, kind of indicted the border czar, Kamala Harris, for not vetting the 12 plus million Harris by the illegals from over 180 countries. And Clinton says, oh, no, no, I was taken out of context. But as always, we report you decide. Take a look at this. Listen to what he says about Lincoln. He killed the Bill. The bill was written, being written by senior Republicans in the Senate. And he killed the Bill. Why? You got a case in Georgia not very long ago. Didn't you? They made an ad about it, about a young woman who'd been killed by an immigrant? Yeah, well, if they'd all been properly vetted, that probably wouldn't have happened. But if they all properly vetted, that doesn't happen. And America is not having enough babies to keep our populations up. So we need immigrants that have been vetted to do work. There wouldn't be a problem. And he couldn't keep people all torn up and upset. The bill was not a border security bill. Wouldn't have even kicked in at less 4, 5,000 illegals first crossed into the country illegally. And then they had the discretion of whether or not they would actually enforce the bill, codifying their open borders policy. He's not telling the truth. An unbedded, Harris-Pide and the illegal immigrant is accused of murdering Lincoln Riley, the same month that the Democrats, so-called border bill, was voted down in the Senate. So nice try. That bill wouldn't do a thing to secure the border, which they lied about. And what telling us for three plus years was secure, secure, and closed. Instead, Harris and Biden, they wanted to use this phony border security bill to hire judges and bureaucrats to process their unvended illegal immigrants into the country faster. Now, this was after more than 12 million already poured into our country. And while Harris, you know, the borders are, looked on, did nothing, lied to the American people, said the border secure. They were convicted of murderers, rapists, felons. Now we have known terrorists in our country. We don't know where they are, but we know they have terrorized all because Joe and Kamala got rid of Trump's successful border protections, and they did it with a stroke of a pen on day one. They didn't need a bill in the first place. And that's why Trump just received a unanimous endorsement from the Border Patrol Union, and Kamala Harris didn't. These are the people who see what has been going on firsthand. And now as we approach a very important election, responsible state governors like Glenn Yunkin, the Commonwealth of Virginia, they have taken measures to clean illegal immigrants, non-citizens that are not eligible to vote from the voter rolls. In doing so, Glenn Yunkin was enforcing a bill signed into law in 2006 by then Governor Democrat Tim Cain, the guy that ran for vice president, requiring the state to maintain the Commonwealth of Virginia's voter rolls, but in a bizarre, crazy insane twist, while the Harris-Biden Pro-Elegal Immigrant Administration, that now suddenly seems to care about border security, they're suing the Commonwealth of Virginia, the state of Virginia, to keep those illegal immigrants on the voter rolls. And by the way, you need picture ID to get into the Democratic Convention, I know, because I went there, I know it was a heavy lift. You need picture ID to get into a presidential, a vice presidential debate, or the White House. Why not voting? Why are Democrats against voter ID, signature verification, proof of citizenship?

The very liberal, New York magazine, calling it, quote, Barack Obama's tiresome condescension towards black men. An op-ed in the Washington Post referred to Obama as the Skolder in Chief and advised the Harris campaign to, quote, steer clear of Obama's instinct for, quote, tough love. So after a heavy dose of judgment from the former president, in this case, Obama, well, Harris campaign continues with more surrogates, but equally insulting tactics. Harris is now promising, you know, a handout and cold hard cash up to 20 grand, in forgivable loan forgiveness, loans that are only available to black entrepreneurs, that they would be the only ones able or eligible to receive it. She, remember, also wants to pay off student loans, and she's vowing to help African Americans invest in cryptocurrency, and she's calling for marijuana to be legalized. But when you, you know, think of the pandering, and you think you can't get any worse, you know, well, think back. She wants to, is this kind of like a vote, buying scheme when you want to pay off student loans for young people that you call stupid, or is it $25,000 down payment to your first home, or $50,000 for other businesses, or what about her running mate, Tim Walls trying to win over male voters with sports and guns, because on Friday during a quick trip to a high school football game, you know, where Walls was a assistant volunteer coach, that kind of claimed he was the coach, was he was almost ignored by the entire crowd. He gave him the silent treatment, and then on Saturday, Walls, he wanted to, you know, show the world what a big second amendment guy he was, and he brought out a shotgun, and he went fesant hunting. And meanwhile, Kamala, she wants mandatory gun buyback. Some might call a confiscation. Unfortunately, this was also a disaster for Walls. He didn't seem to know how to load his own gun. You decide. That fight during, and it never fits quite right. You know, it's not quite right. How do you give it back? Governor, what kind of gun is this? This is a Burreta A400. I bought it when I was shooting a lot of trap, because it has a kind of their patented thing that kick off, so when you get old, it doesn't hurt your shoulders much. It's probably been 15 years since I pulled that sucker out. Anyway, of course, this trip wasn't all about guns and hunting. Walls also trying to connect with this fellow guy, you know, pounding down a diet mountain do. I prefer regular. Take a look. Don't get in. That's it. Well, it's hunting, not shooting, right? You knew it, didn't you, man. And I'm going to grab a diet mountain do if we got one, and I'm going to pound one down. I think that Walls is bad. Just waiting to hear about the next campaign's surrogate. Can't make this up either. In another desperate attempt to win over men, the Harris campaign turned to Bill Clinton. How you doing? Good to see you. Slick, Willie, I'm back. I'm all by myself. Hillary's on vacation. Unfortunately, Slick, Willie, is not as slick as he used to be. And today, when trying to blame Trump for the border crisis, which was secure when they inherited it, and they bragged about for three years, the border being closed, the border being secure, and bragging about undoing all the Trump border policies that brought us the lowest level of illegal immigration in decades. Bill Clinton, unfortunately, kind of indicted the border czar, Kamala Harris, for not vetting the 12 plus million Harris by the illegals from over 180 countries. And Clinton says, oh, no, no, I was taken out of context. But as always, we report you decide. Take a look at this. Listen to what he says about Lincoln. He killed the Bill. The bill was written, being written by senior Republicans in the Senate. And he killed the Bill. Why? You got a case in Georgia not very long ago. Didn't you? They made an ad about it, about a young woman who'd been killed by an immigrant? Yeah, well, if they'd all been properly vetted, that probably wouldn't have happened. But if they all properly vetted, that doesn't happen. And America is not having enough babies to keep our populations up. So we need immigrants that have been vetted to do work. There wouldn't be a problem. And he couldn't keep people all torn up and upset. The bill was not a border security bill. Wouldn't have even kicked in at less 4, 5,000 illegals first crossed into the country illegally. And then they had the discretion of whether or not they would actually enforce the bill, codifying their open borders policy. He's not telling the truth. An unbedded, Harris-Pide and the illegal immigrant is accused of murdering Lincoln Riley, the same month that the Democrats, so-called border bill, was voted down in the Senate. So nice try. That bill wouldn't do a thing to secure the border, which they lied about. And what telling us for three plus years was secure, secure, and closed. Instead, Harris and Biden, they wanted to use this phony border security bill to hire judges and bureaucrats to process their unvended illegal immigrants into the country faster. Now, this was after more than 12 million already poured into our country. And while Harris, you know, the borders are, looked on, did nothing, lied to the American people, said the border secure. They were convicted of murderers, rapists, felons. Now we have known terrorists in our country. We don't know where they are, but we know they have terrorized all because Joe and Kamala got rid of Trump's successful border protections, and they did it with a stroke of a pen on day one. They didn't need a bill in the first place. And that's why Trump just received a unanimous endorsement from the Border Patrol Union, and Kamala Harris didn't. These are the people who see what has been going on firsthand. And now as we approach a very important election, responsible state governors like Glenn Yunkin, the Commonwealth of Virginia, they have taken measures to clean illegal immigrants, non-citizens that are not eligible to vote from the voter rolls. In doing so, Glenn Yunkin was enforcing a bill signed into law in 2006 by then Governor Democrat Tim Cain, the guy that ran for vice president, requiring the state to maintain the Commonwealth of Virginia's voter rolls, but in a bizarre, crazy insane twist, while the Harris-Biden Pro-Elegal Immigrant Administration, that now suddenly seems to care about border security, they're suing the Commonwealth of Virginia, the state of Virginia, to keep those illegal immigrants on the voter rolls. And by the way, you need picture ID to get into the Democratic Convention, I know, because I went there, I know it was a heavy lift. You need picture ID to get into a presidential, a vice presidential debate, or the White House. Why not voting? Why are Democrats against voter ID, signature verification, proof of citizenship?

The Five: Harris-Walz campaign shoots blanks in quest for 'bro vote',https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtuVtOSBz0g,2024-10-14 23:30:07+00:00,Kamala Harris blowout victory?,0.6573528051376343," Kamala scrambling to win back male voters who were ditching her in droves for Donald Trump. But so far, her bro pandering has been a total joke. Harris sending out herself proclaimed knucklehead to go fessant hunting. But he couldn't even get that one right after fumbling around with his shotgun. Yeah, that fight hearing and it never fits quite right. You just not quite right. How do you give it back? Governor, what kind of gun is this? This is a burretta A400. I brought it when I was shooting a lot of trap because it has a kind of their patented thing that kicked off. So when you get old, it doesn't hurt your shoulders. Kamala is also deploying another man, Bill Clinton, to win over voters in Georgia but that too was a flop after a McDonald's worker confused Clinton for Joe Biden. Take a look. Oh, you got a lot of people. Look at that. All right, Jesse, I'll start with you on the gun. Okay, so Tim Wall says he's a lifelong, what is it? A lifelong bird hunter and he claims that he is very proficient with guns. What I just saw and what I've read from people who are experts is that this guy doesn't even know how to load a gun or he doesn't know certainly how to, if there's a problem with a gun, get it to reload. So my shooting instructor said the bolt release and the safety is on the right side of the gun. That's a right handed gun. He's holding it like he's left handed. That's why he's struggling. So he says he clearly doesn't have a clue. They also went out and never shot a thing and Walls never even pulled the trigger. This was the one reason Kamala picked Walls because he could handle a gun. That's like a guy who women aren't voting for him. So he taps a female VP and she changes the diaper and puts the diaper on backwards. That's how bad this is. Now we also watched him under the hood one time when he changed a clean air filter with a clean air filter. Now I didn't notice, Tyrus noticed it. Right. It shows you how much I know about trucks. But he is actually hurting her with men. And then you send Bill Clinton out and Bill Clinton says, well, the great replacement theory, yeah, that's true. We do need these people because we don't have enough birth rate here and they do all the jobs. And then he said if these migrants have been properly vetted, then Lincoln Riley would still be alive. And this is after Bill, this is after Barat just scolded black men. Not only the primary not doing well with men, but all the surrogates are blowing it too. You know, I think that Barack Obama, when he went out, he berated is, or certainly that's one word you could use a black man for not supporting Kamala. The interesting thing is that it was Barack Obama who first came out when they threw Joe under the bus and said he didn't believe Kamala could be Trump. And now all of a sudden he's on the Trump train, on the Kamala train, I should say. The politicians have changes of heart. We all have documents. It was like three days. Right. But I mean, people can change their minds. And I respect when people change their minds. We had a change that we could go here about Democrats praising this chain, but being critical of others for supporting President Trump. So I understand that too. It shows what happened to Bill Clinton and the McDonald's. We all have a shelf life. And he had to say his name. It was going to come a time when it could be next week when no one recognizes me or any of us. I'm happy. Once he said his name, that the young lady came up from behind the counter and blessed her heart. Three, when President Trump was in Detroit, I think it was a week ago, and he said if Kamala Harris wins, then the rest of the country will look like Detroit. He was speaking in Detroit at the economic club. He probably misspoke. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. He probably didn't mean that. So I, people say things, and they do things. Tim Malta is a 24-year military veteran. I think he knows exactly what he's doing with guns. And sometimes that stuff happens. I think I jammed. And to say he doesn't know what he's doing, I think it's probably unfair. I wouldn't dispute a gun instructor. You're gun instructor. But I do think things can happen when that goes about surrogates. I think Elon Musk and Dana White have been pretty effective surrogates for Donald Trump. And I understand it as a message to basically take advantage of the gap that exists in the art electorate where men seem to be more likely to vote for President Trump. And women seem more likely to be voting for Vice President Harris. I get that. So having surrogates out be a Barack Obama or others campaigning on a behalf, I think is a good thing. Now I would agree with you with President Obama. I thought it was an interesting way to try to persuade a voter by lecturing. And I'm never in my little experience in politics. I've always tried to persuade voters with facts and explain why they should be on my side as opposed to telling them why they're wrong or why they should be thinking differently than they are. But he'll get it right the next time. Finally, we live in a world we live into economies. We have lived for a long time in that way, where middle class and less than the lower than the middle class, so people economically speaking, are trying to find their way to higher ground. And people who are rich have just gotten richer over the last 20 years. If I were Vice President Harris and I've said this for a while, state your policies and ideas and how they're going to make any group of Americans black, white, old, young, whatever they may live, whatever their background might be. Explain how you're going to, how your policies and not your opponents' policies are going to help get them to higher ground in a better place. The closer we get to that, the more we get there, the less we talk about race, the better the country will be off and the better these campaigns will be off in the long run as well. Well, there's no question, Dana. It was President Obama who said that he would not only lectured black males, but he also said that they're probably not supporting her because she's a woman. Now, the amazing part of that is that for Barack Obama to say that when Hillary Clinton did better with the unions, Hillary Clinton did better with black men, it's kind of, it's almost like it's forced from him. Well, not only that, but I think it's just a little bit off in the evidence because the same people were not for Biden. Exactly. So, I don't think it's a sexism thing, it's a policy thing. Right. So, when you look at Tim Walls, you think, Tim, you had one job. Your job was to be like a normal guy from the Midwest. And look, if guns aren't your thing, that's cool. There's a lot of guys who aren't for that either. You don't have to do, you don't have to try to do that. You could just be your progressive self, go out there and try to support her. That video is so painful. I had like that transferred embarrassment of a friend, like, oh my gosh, I can't even watch this. But it goes back to the idea that MSNBC pundits think that Tim Walls is the kind of guy that all the other guys want to be. And that that's the kind of masculinity that you're looking for. And it's just, it's like off. I don't quite understand it, but I am fascinated by the gender gap. But I think, I hope, again, I hope I live long enough to read about the history of this election. But this is about, like, just like anything this past weekend really did feel like an episode of Veepe. There's nothing more that has encapsulated the hand-handedness of this campaign than that video there with Elmer Fud and that orange. Yeah. Elmer Fud. And I think that's one more thing that when the coach, also known as the real assistant coach, went to a high school football game where he was an assistant coach. He got a didn't quite get the reception that he was expecting. A lot of booze there. I think there's a lot about him that is probably not what we think it is. And I'm sure he'd really embarrassed his friends, those school shooters, with that shotgun display. It's like, what are you two, mate? Come on, buddy. Bill Clinton was just happy they did mistaken for Jimmy Carter. No. Because I mean, Bill, Jimmy, where are we now? Bill Clinton looks terrible. Yeah. He really looks bad. But anyway, let's talk about that. I want to talk about that men for Kamala ad where they actually had a higher actors to play the male voters because they couldn't find any. And while they're doing that, you have Elon Musk unveiling new robots, a driverless bus that's beautiful. He sends a rocket into space that's in the land. And it's like insane. You're saying, and you mentioned Elon Musk and Dana White. And you're thinking to yourself, you know what? That's what men like. That's what men are. This thing, whatever they're doing, whether it is a tampon Tim or what the ads, that's not men, real outreach. What you're doing is you're treating men again like a faceless mass, a group that you can exploit, just like the Dems do with blacks and women. And no real, it exception to you, Harold, although I don't really believe your for a wester face, Kamala. I just can't believe it because no real man on earth has a problem defining a woman, no real man on earth says you can have a penis and be female. There's no real man that believes you should be teaching like anal sex to kids. No real man think it's fair to put like muscular men up against females in sports or put male sex offenders in female prisoners, prisoners just because they happen to grow their hair out. You know, you're not a man if you ascribe to any of that. And if you vote for Kamala, you are voting for that. That's why no, Harold, you are not voting for Kamala. I am going to bet I want to see you take a picture of the ballot because I don't believe you're going to do it. I think you're going to vote third party. Greg Gutfeld. Right it is. And your face. I said voting for her. It says, all right, up next Bill Clinton just told the shocking truth about Kamala and the border crisis."

Biden-Harris tensions grow: New details revealed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR5U9ATSzAQ,2024-10-14 19:00:23+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win the 2024 US Presidential Election?,0.6191301345825195," All right, a new Axios report suggests there is a growing rip between President Biden and Vice President Harris and each of their staffs as we're just three weeks out from Election Day. Yep, Senior White House correspondent Jackie Heinrich joins us with the latest Jackie. Good morning, guys. Axios reports things are frosty between the VP's campaign team and the White House just before the run up to the election and quote, some on the Harris team say that top White House aides aren't sufficiently coordinating Biden's messaging and his scheduled campaign with what's best for the Vice President's campaign. They highlighted a few times the President's and Promptu remarks conflicted with an event that Harris was doing, upending the media coverage that Harris would then receive. Like when Biden twice gave in Promptu remarks in the hurricane, just when Harris was about to speak from the campaign trail. These campaign sources go on to accuse the White House of lacking someone in the room to think first and foremost about how things would affect the campaign. However, I've been talking about these same things with folks from the White House. They've been increasingly frustrated that Harris's campaign keeps winning the President in a tough spot like when she publicly picked a fight with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis over not taking her calls. I spoke with three sources in the President's orbit about all that. They agreed it was a dumb thing for Harris to do and that DeSantis and Biden had been coordinating on the response Biden was not going to dump on the Florida Governor whose state was about to be humbled by a storm. So when reporters asked whether DeSantis should be taking her calls, of course the President was going to deflect. And then the media sounded off about how he started with DeSantis over his Vice President, but this in their view was a situation of her making. These sources felt that the decisions that the Harris campaign was making showed their relative inexperience and novice and while he's been bending over backwards to give her opportunities to demonstrate her leadership, she's fumbled it a couple of times, guys. And Jackie, according to the Axios article and they talked to 10 people, which is a lot of people. It's not just one or two. Some of the Biden people, either from the campaign or the White House, join the Kamala Harris team, but they feel like they are being labeled disloyal by all their friends and so that's causing some of the problem and some of the tension. Well, it's sort of a Frankenstein operation when you consider there's the former Biden campaign folks, the Biden loyalist, the Obama era people who joined the campaign, Harris's team that transitioned to the campaign. New people that they've brought in, they sort of threw this together because there's such a tight run up to the election, but there are competing factions. It affects us when we're trying to get a statement because you've got to get sign off from so many different people, whereas it used to be pretty streamlined when it was under Joe Biden. So, Jackie, thank you. Sure. Thanks. This is my favorite story of the day for many reasons. Look, it's normal for the Vice President's office to kind of be siloed from the president. That was the case with James. You know, yes, you work as a team, but they have their own agenda. They have things they're working on. You're in a different building. Well, same building the Vice President's office, but yes, some of his teams across the street in the old executive office building. But here's what's not normal for President Biden to storm out in a press conference while she's about to take the stage and miss you again. Not only that, he knows she needs to distance herself from him and she said she was a part of all the decisions. She helped pass all the laws. Then you have the DeSantis mix messaging, but the most telling part of this story is you have Andrew Bates going on the record dismissing this. You have the White House denying this and the most important line of the Axio story. Harris officials, her office and her campaign declined to comment. If I would have been asked about this with Pence, I would have said, this isn't true. No, there's nothing to this. They stayed silent. Well, also, I would add this. It's going to get worse. Of course it is. This is the week that she realized the biggest mistakes she made last week. She had a terrible week last week. Because there's nothing between us. And then when she was asked to fix it on a commercial break, she came back and says, yeah, I know one thing we do different. I'd put a Republican on my staff. Not good enough. Now, because most people want change. She was grading higher than Trump on someone to bring change. That number is shrinking because she's saying, I'm not going to be a change by her answer because she doesn't pre-think anything. Well, Brian, no one briefs her and she can't retain it. There's a double whammy because there's two questions that she's been asked consistently that she has no answer really, too. Or the answer is the non-answer. They've asked her, why haven't you done it now, right? And she's under impression that things are going well right now. And then the second question is, is there anything that you disagree with Joe Biden? Maybe they may feel like the current president is trying to sabotage her in some type of way, but her answer and his answer are the same. So I do find it very peculiar in the last 20 days that if there is going to be some type of change in messaging, is she suddenly going to start saying that she disagrees with the president? She's the vote on that. You should have done this during the debate. That's exactly what I'm saying. National audience. You can't fool us now. I'll tell you today. I think what's happening, and we've seen it a lot over the last 48 hours, is suddenly people in the mainstream media are starting to explain why Donald Trump is going to win. Yes. The axiost thing is about, look, behind the scenes, it was a knife fight, you know, his team, her team. And then you look at the front page of the New York Times yesterday, a Nate Cohen has a great thing that describes something that we've been talking about for a while. Why Donald Trump is gaining so many African Americans and Hispanic voters. And the article was possible explanations, why it is. And so people can start to get their head around why she is unpopular, but why he is popular and why he might win. They're just setting the table. Because the polls have gotten really close. And she plateaued a couple of weeks ago. Yeah, it's not over, but I would say that this is a December conversation. It shouldn't be an October conversation."
Biden-Harris tensions grow: New details revealed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR5U9ATSzAQ,2024-10-14 19:00:23+00:00,Kamala flips a 2020 Trump state?,0.6182996034622192," All right, a new Axios report suggests there is a growing rip between President Biden and Vice President Harris and each of their staffs as we're just three weeks out from Election Day. Yep, Senior White House correspondent Jackie Heinrich joins us with the latest Jackie. Good morning, guys. Axios reports things are frosty between the VP's campaign team and the White House just before the run up to the election and quote, some on the Harris team say that top White House aides aren't sufficiently coordinating Biden's messaging and his scheduled campaign with what's best for the Vice President's campaign. They highlighted a few times the President's and Promptu remarks conflicted with an event that Harris was doing, upending the media coverage that Harris would then receive. Like when Biden twice gave in Promptu remarks in the hurricane, just when Harris was about to speak from the campaign trail. These campaign sources go on to accuse the White House of lacking someone in the room to think first and foremost about how things would affect the campaign. However, I've been talking about these same things with folks from the White House. They've been increasingly frustrated that Harris's campaign keeps winning the President in a tough spot like when she publicly picked a fight with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis over not taking her calls. I spoke with three sources in the President's orbit about all that. They agreed it was a dumb thing for Harris to do and that DeSantis and Biden had been coordinating on the response Biden was not going to dump on the Florida Governor whose state was about to be humbled by a storm. So when reporters asked whether DeSantis should be taking her calls, of course the President was going to deflect. And then the media sounded off about how he started with DeSantis over his Vice President, but this in their view was a situation of her making. These sources felt that the decisions that the Harris campaign was making showed their relative inexperience and novice and while he's been bending over backwards to give her opportunities to demonstrate her leadership, she's fumbled it a couple of times, guys. And Jackie, according to the Axios article and they talked to 10 people, which is a lot of people. It's not just one or two. Some of the Biden people, either from the campaign or the White House, join the Kamala Harris team, but they feel like they are being labeled disloyal by all their friends and so that's causing some of the problem and some of the tension. Well, it's sort of a Frankenstein operation when you consider there's the former Biden campaign folks, the Biden loyalist, the Obama era people who joined the campaign, Harris's team that transitioned to the campaign. New people that they've brought in, they sort of threw this together because there's such a tight run up to the election, but there are competing factions. It affects us when we're trying to get a statement because you've got to get sign off from so many different people, whereas it used to be pretty streamlined when it was under Joe Biden. So, Jackie, thank you. Sure. Thanks. This is my favorite story of the day for many reasons. Look, it's normal for the Vice President's office to kind of be siloed from the president. That was the case with James. You know, yes, you work as a team, but they have their own agenda. They have things they're working on. You're in a different building. Well, same building the Vice President's office, but yes, some of his teams across the street in the old executive office building. But here's what's not normal for President Biden to storm out in a press conference while she's about to take the stage and miss you again. Not only that, he knows she needs to distance herself from him and she said she was a part of all the decisions. She helped pass all the laws. Then you have the DeSantis mix messaging, but the most telling part of this story is you have Andrew Bates going on the record dismissing this. You have the White House denying this and the most important line of the Axio story. Harris officials, her office and her campaign declined to comment. If I would have been asked about this with Pence, I would have said, this isn't true. No, there's nothing to this. They stayed silent. Well, also, I would add this. It's going to get worse. Of course it is. This is the week that she realized the biggest mistakes she made last week. She had a terrible week last week. Because there's nothing between us. And then when she was asked to fix it on a commercial break, she came back and says, yeah, I know one thing we do different. I'd put a Republican on my staff. Not good enough. Now, because most people want change. She was grading higher than Trump on someone to bring change. That number is shrinking because she's saying, I'm not going to be a change by her answer because she doesn't pre-think anything. Well, Brian, no one briefs her and she can't retain it.

NASCAR legend describes crowd's reaction to JD Vance appearing at Charlotte race,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzipY1vipOU,2024-10-14 16:45:00+00:00,Trump-Vance Republican ticket on election day?,0.6273030042648315," And also as a race trackwise presidential nominee, JD Vance decided to make a quick pit stop on Sunday, visiting the Charlotte Motor Speedway to attend his first NASCAR race. Vance met up with current drivers and legends of the sport, including car owner, Richard Childress, who is publicly supporting the Trump Vance ticket. And he joins me now, the owner of Richard Childress Racing, Richard Childress himself. Good morning to you, sir. Thank you so much for coming on. Good morning, Carly. Great to be here. What in the day at the track we wanted, but it was a great day to have Senator Vance, his family there, and really just to see how excited he was to be around the fans and pictures, everything. He was just right in there with him. Yeah, and this was apparently his first time at a race track, and you were saying you got to meet with his kids and they even got to sit in the driver's seat of a race car. Yeah, I came to Austin, Dylan's car. I just wanted to address another one of our cars and carbushes there. And picked up both of his boys and each one of them wanted to get in the car and feel like they were driving. They get that steering wheel and just smiles so big. Oh, that's so cute. I'm sure that's a memory that they'll never forget. So, you know, we said it, you're publicly supporting the Trump Vance ticket, but there were thousands and thousands of NASCAR fans at this race yesterday as well. What was their reaction to seeing JD Vance in attendance? It was great. Everyone was just cheering him and everyone wanted to get over, everyone wanted to get over close, get pictures, see him shake his hand, holler, and tell him what a great job how they're looking forward to having him as our next vice president. Yeah, and I know Donald Trump has attended some races as well. You've known him for many years now. What do you think it is that NASCAR fans like the most about Donald Trump? Yeah, he's a real deal. He's someone that loves this country. I've known him since the early 90s. He hasn't changed a bit for what he thinks about this great country we live in. And, you know, he wants everything's the best for us. And that's why the NASCAR fans love Donald Trump. So, they resonate with that America first agenda and message? Yes, they definitely do. And just to see how passionate he is and talking to Senator Batchas, saying him talking about only in America, only in America could things like we're doing today be happening. Yeah, can you believe that the presidential elections in 22 days, I mean, it's just three weeks away? Your sense, I mean, you live in North Carolina. That's a swing state. What do you think's gonna happen? I think he's got a great chance here. It's gonna be a tight race. You know, the thing, Carly, that gets me is bait and switch. I'm sure you've heard of that. You tell people things to get them to go your way and then you switch once you get them. That's exactly what they're doing today. They're jumping on board with everything. And once they could get in, which we hopefully don't, then they'll change. They'll switch us. I promise. Well, I mentioned that you live in North Carolina and I understand that you've sent a lot of things to the areas impacted by the storm. You said what, 10 whole truckloads full of supplies? Yeah, about every day since we've been sending the like 20 foot trailer trucks because we can't get to tractor and trailers up there. My son-in-law Mike Dylan, he's headed up with Samantha's purse, which is a great organization. And we've been sending everything from all over the neighborhood. Out of states, he even bring it in. And we've been sending stuff every day. We'll be sending stuff up today as well. That's great. And you made a good point. It's getting cold up there. So they're going to need a lot of warm coats and clothes. And clearly, you have a big heart. This is a storm that impacted the state that you love. And we won't forget the people of North Carolina. Richard, children, thank you so much for joining us. Have a great day. Fox and Friends starts right now. I'm Steve Ducy. I'm Brian Killme. And I mean, it's a rare heart.

Hezbollah launches deadliest drone attack on Israel since invasion,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pup56wrvBs8,2024-10-14 14:15:33+00:00,U.S. military strike on Lebanon before November?,0.644097089767456," The Hezbollah drone attack killing four Israeli soldiers and wounding dozens of others in the deadliest strike by the Iranian back-taired group since Israel launched its ground invasion into Lebanon nearly two weeks ago. We're going to get more on this and welcome to a brand new hour of America's newsroom. I'm Dana Perina, good morning again. Good morning. Good morning to you. Yeah, I'm Bill Hemberg and morning. A lot of worry now about what happens next in the Middle East. The deadly drone attack coming as Israeli troops moved deeper in the southern Lebanon, fighting the end of Hezbollah's ability to target northern Israel, and allow tens of thousands of Israeli evacuees to go home. They haven't been there in a year. Sunday's drone attack came the same day the U.S. said it would send Israel a new air defense system to try and increase protection from those missiles. General Jack Keane last hour describing the system's advanced capabilities. Obviously, helped the Israelis in the last two Iranian attacks from the air and also from the sea, and they want to complement their own air defense systems with this rather sophisticated and advanced system that the United States has. The radar can see and track a missile launch 1800 miles away, and that's pretty significant because Iran is 1100 miles away. And Trey Yings is alive in Haifa, Israel, where there's activity this morning and afternoon, I should say. Good morning and afternoon to you, Trey. Yeah, Dana, good morning. A lot of rocket-fire targeting northern Israel today, and yesterday's attack was the deadliest drone attack against Israel since the war began. Four Israeli soldiers killed and 51 injured when a Hezbollah attack drone slammed into a dining hall at a military base north of Tel Aviv. Today Israel's chief of staff, Hertz-A-11, and the country's defense minister, Yav, Galen, to visit in the site. And officials saying this is yet another reason why Israeli forces have to continue their ground operation against Hezbollah. We join those forces over the weekend for a firsthand look at the ongoing war. Right now we're with Israel's 91st Division under Northern command headed to a Shia village in the southern part of Lebanon, arriving nearly two miles from the border with Israel. These soldiers are on high alert. The battle against Hezbollah reaches on in the distance. Much of the group's former stronghold is being reduced to rubble. Twisted metal and mountains of concrete mark where buildings once stood. We see these bulldozers here, like this one behind me, a lot of destruction to civilian homes. Why did this have to happen in this village? Well, as you've seen in your own eyes, some of the evidence that we've visited here are an enemy outpost hidden within civilian population, within suburban area. Inside some of those homes, an arsenal of weapons with sniper rifles, grenades and anti-tank missiles. There are questions about where all of this equipment came from and what it was going to be used for. A weapon story literally go my mind. Brand you. Okay, 1847. Warming science, that's what we are going to do. To clear all these weapons, all these ammunition from here and get our civilians and go back to their home. And then Lebanese civilians will be allowed to return to this village? Of course. Despite promises from the IDF that civilians will be able to return home, further down the border, Israeli forces were seen on a video posted to social media, raising the Israeli flag, while officials talk of building a buffer zone between the two countries. This while Lebanese civilians like Fatima and her new baby Rita, two of more than 1.2 million displaced, wait to return home. The situation got very bad, Fatima explains they began hitting our village and said we had to leave the village, so we fled. And the other day, the city of Al-Bala, a horrific fire erupted afterwards in a possible secondary explosion. The Israelis say they were targeting a command center for Hamas. And local media says that multiple civilians were killed. We are still gathering details following that event in Gaza overnight. Dana. Thank you. Thanks."

Harris not going to get there with core Dem voters: Samantha Dravis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtfAda4wGMQ,2024-10-12 13:30:30+00:00,Kamala Harris wins a solid red state?,0.6533865928649902," We want to continue the conversation and discuss the state of the presidential race tonight with news busters managing editor Curtis Hauke and former senior counsel at the EPA Samantha Dravis. Samantha Limmett, again with you, I want to share this presidential preference among Hispanic voters. A lot of people really curious about how well or how poorly the race may go for the existing vice president in particular. As we take a look at the numbers, you see right now at 57 give or take to 37. In Arizona and 56 to 39 in Nevada. Now at first blush, you may say, yeah, looks pretty fine. But if you really drill down, that's a real warning sign I imagine for Kamala Harris. Well, it is because there has been a trend since 2016 of Republicans gaining more support with Latino voters. But right now, Harris is well behind where Biden was in 2020 with Latino voters. Latino population obviously significant in Arizona and Nevada. I actually saw USA today poll that showed that Latino men under the age of 49 Trump is leading by 13 points. Wow. So these core Democrat constituencies, Harris is underperforming. She's not going to get there with the way things look right now. You know what? Speaking of that, I want to share this Curtis to get you to weigh in on it. This actually will take us back to 2020 with some anthologist reference. This is the voter analysis Latina or Hispanics Biden 63 to 35 over the former president. And I think this speaks to this greater trend, especially if you go all the way back to 2012. If you're a Democrat and you're looking at how they're fairing with Hispanic voters, this has got to be deeply troubling. Yeah, they're hemorrhaging Hispanic support. I mean, the media, we see this from our perspective at newsbusters and this is reflected, I guess, in the campaign messaging. They're really desperate. You know, you see this very similarly with black men, with Barack Obama being brought in it. It's almost a shaming instead of grappling with the fact that Hispanics aren't a monolith and they're concerned about many of the same things that other Americans are concerned about. Jobs, border security, crime, education, fallout from COVID, you name it, you go on down the list. And that's why the left, I think, wants to debate the selection on other issues, particularly January 6th, abortion, you name it, their issues. They want to fight on their turf instead of things that are popular with the American people. Right. You nailed it. I think you make a really good point. Let me follow up and ask you about why you think this trend is shifting so dramatically Samantha because Curtis really talked about some real issues and yet at the same time, when I look at the tabs and the breakouts, they are not buying what Kamala Harris in particular seems to be selling. Yeah, you're right. I mean, I think the top two issues still for all voters are the economy and immigration. I think legal immigrants in particular are outraged by the illegal immigration crisis that they've seen under the Biden-Harris administration. They're not buying what she's selling. She's changed her substantive position on almost every single important policy issue. I think she's coming off as disingenuous and dishonest and that's coming through in the polling. You know, I'm so glad you mentioned the idea that legal immigrants have a real problem. It's happening down at the border right now. I know many and they are furious. They feel like this is deeply unfair. Very quickly, I want to share a quick sound bite. This is the DNC Curtis actually making a six-figure ad buy in many of the swing states. Listen and then I'll tell you why and who this is about. Stein was key to Trump's 2016 wins in Battleground States. She's not sorry. She helped Trump win. That's why a vote for Stein. It's really a vote for Trump. First time we've seen them issue in a sort of a real challenge to a third party candidate in this way. I've never seen this happen. Certainly not to this level. 45 seconds, Curtis. Yeah, I mean, this is the same thing we see with Hillary Clinton talking about censorship. They're talking about Jill Stein again. Like we're never going to get over 2016, are we? You know, we as a country, we talk about 2020, 2016 is the one election that nobody really seems ready to move on from Barack Obama still relitigating 2016 as well. That's one between this and the men ad that we played at the beginning of the show. This is one of some of the creepiest ads I've seen. I mean, which side is weird? You know, the less talk about JD Vance being weird, this is some weird stuff. You know, I would love to get you to weigh in more on this event, but I don't want to cheat you out of your time. But I will just note that in watching that ad that we just saw there, the men for the vice president was... Well, let's just call it unique. And I'm wondering, will that resonate with women, do you think? No, I don't think it will. I think that this campaign is willing to do anything except take responsibility for the policies that the voters don't like and that aren't resonating with them. So, you know, it just goes back to their identity politics that this party is based around, and they don't want to accept that that's not really working anymore.

Harris not going to get there with core Dem voters: Samantha Dravis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtfAda4wGMQ,2024-10-12 13:30:30+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win California by the largest margin?,0.6267544031143188," We want to continue the conversation and discuss the state of the presidential race tonight with news busters managing editor Curtis Hauke and former senior counsel at the EPA Samantha Dravis. Samantha Limmett, again with you, I want to share this presidential preference among Hispanic voters. A lot of people really curious about how well or how poorly the race may go for the existing vice president in particular. As we take a look at the numbers, you see right now at 57 give or take to 37. In Arizona and 56 to 39 in Nevada. Now at first blush, you may say, yeah, looks pretty fine. But if you really drill down, that's a real warning sign I imagine for Kamala Harris. Well, it is because there has been a trend since 2016 of Republicans gaining more support with Latino voters. But right now, Harris is well behind where Biden was in 2020 with Latino voters. Latino population obviously significant in Arizona and Nevada. I actually saw USA today poll that showed that Latino men under the age of 49 Trump is leading by 13 points. Wow. So these core Democrat constituencies, Harris is underperforming. She's not going to get there with the way things look right now. You know what? Speaking of that, I want to share this Curtis to get you to weigh in on it. This actually will take us back to 2020 with some anthologist reference. This is the voter analysis Latina or Hispanics Biden 63 to 35 over the former president. And I think this speaks to this greater trend, especially if you go all the way back to 2012. If you're a Democrat and you're looking at how they're fairing with Hispanic voters, this has got to be deeply troubling. Yeah, they're hemorrhaging Hispanic support. I mean, the media, we see this from our perspective at newsbusters and this is reflected, I guess, in the campaign messaging. They're really desperate. You know, you see this very similarly with black men, with Barack Obama being brought in it. It's almost a shaming instead of grappling with the fact that Hispanics aren't a monolith and they're concerned about many of the same things that other Americans are concerned about. Jobs, border security, crime, education, fallout from COVID, you name it, you go on down the list. And that's why the left, I think, wants to debate the selection on other issues, particularly January 6th, abortion, you name it, their issues. They want to fight on their turf instead of things that are popular with the American people. Right. You nailed it. I think you make a really good point. Let me follow up and ask you about why you think this trend is shifting so dramatically Samantha because Curtis really talked about some real issues and yet at the same time, when I look at the tabs and the breakouts, they are not buying what Kamala Harris in particular seems to be selling. Yeah, you're right. I mean, I think the top two issues still for all voters are the economy and immigration. I think legal immigrants in particular are outraged by the illegal immigration crisis that they've seen under the Biden-Harris administration. They're not buying what she's selling. She's changed her substantive position on almost every single important policy issue. I think she's coming off as disingenuous and dishonest and that's coming through in the polling. You know, I'm so glad you mentioned the idea that legal immigrants have a real problem. It's happening down at the border right now. I know many and they are furious. They feel like this is deeply unfair. Very quickly, I want to share a quick sound bite. This is the DNC Curtis actually making a six-figure ad buy in many of the swing states. Listen and then I'll tell you why and who this is about. Stein was key to Trump's 2016 wins in Battleground States. She's not sorry. She helped Trump win. That's why a vote for Stein. It's really a vote for Trump. First time we've seen them issue in a sort of a real challenge to a third party candidate in this way. I've never seen this happen. Certainly not to this level. 45 seconds, Curtis. Yeah, I mean, this is the same thing we see with Hillary Clinton talking about censorship. They're talking about Jill Stein again. Like we're never going to get over 2016, are we? You know, we as a country, we talk about 2020, 2016 is the one election that nobody really seems ready to move on from Barack Obama still relitigating 2016 as well.

Jesse Watters: The media thinks male voters are in 'crisis'?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtBA5F7zRyg,2024-10-12 01:30:07+00:00,Will George W. Bush endorse Kamala Harris?,0.641268253326416," Kamala Harris has a man problem. White dudes for Harris isn't working. And the Ombres don't trust her. Right now leaning towards Trump, but I haven't made a decision. I'm also concerned about the way I feel President Biden was pushed to side. Oh. And as Obama said, Harris also has a problem with the brothers. Well, now Joe Biden's out and Kamala's in. What do you think of her? God bitch. She's for herself. I don't know what she did when she was a vice president. I don't know what she gonna do now. She's part of the problem of the country. I love you because she's black. You don't vote for nobody because of any color. You know, you go for what good they can do. No, she could be. She could be the devil in disguise. Donors are admitting men are gone, but Democrats say Kamala Harris isn't the issue. Men are and they should see a psychiatrist. I think men are in crisis actually in this country. I think that plays out different ways. And not all men are in crisis, of course. And not all men are just at home listening to Joe Rogan, being angry or being recruited to fascism. Some just need therapy, like we all do. We need to have a real conversation about that, rather than allowing this kind of drift toward this faux masculinity that we see Donald Trump advancing. Do you really think Kamala's losing because men are in crisis? No. Real men aren't in crisis, but these guys are. I'm man enough to be emotional in front of my wife. I'm part of my kids. In front of my horse. I'm man enough to tell you that I cry. I love actually. Good will hunting. Wish I had stories. That ambrated. I'm sick of so-called men, domineering, belittling, and controlling women, just so they can feel more powerful. That's not how my mama raised me. I love women. I love women who support their families. Women who decide not to have families. Women who take charge. And I'm man enough to help them win. So if you don't cry in front of your horse, or I love actually, you're not a real man. And you need to see a shrink who will prescribe you medication that'll turn you into a zombie, and allow you to enjoy being bossed around by a pretty woman. I just hope that all the women here tonight talk to all the men that aren't here tonight. And all you brave men that are here tonight. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Talk to all the other men that aren't here tonight. And let's just get it going, enough with the fighting. Let's get to the uniting. Let's get to the joy. That's the Democrat's idea of a brave man. Not a copper or soldier. Guy, you get shot and pops back up. Democrats believe a brave man goes to Kamala rallies. And nags their buddies into voting Democrat. But if a pretty woman doesn't do it for you, maybe the Messiah can turn you on. I'm sorry, gentlemen. I've noticed this especially with some men who seem to think Trump's behavior, the bullying, and the putting people down, is a sign of strength. And I am here to tell you that is not what real strength is. Don't get it twisted, fellas. This is what a real man looks like. This is the kind of strapping masculinity that Democrats idolize. Michelle, I'll be right up. I'm almost finished my set. The kind of guy that loves vanilla soft surf. Take me out to the ballgame, Barry. And then he told black men vote for Kamala or you ain't black. We have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all courts of our neighborhoods and communities we saw when I was running. I also want to say that that seems to be more pronounced with the brothers. You're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses. I've got a problem with that because part of it makes me think. I'm speaking to men directly. Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president. Trump says Kamala may have lost another brother. Quote, I think Obama will be voting for me because he doesn't like the fact that Kamala is an extremely low IQ person. Obama is trying to glue his shattered coalition back together, but it's going to take more than Barry scolding black men as sexist race traders to win the male vote. Democrats know it. Why are black men being lecture two? Why are black men being belittled? For him to single out black men is wrong. And some of the black men that I have talked to have their reasons why they want to vote a different way. When less president Barack Obama is going to go out and lecture every other group of men from other identity groups, my message for Democrats is don't bring it here to black men who buy in large don't vote much differently from black women. No, sounds like Barry's in trouble with the ladies. So they're moving on to plan B. Slaping a helmet on coach walls and throwing him into the game to tackle white guys and drag him to the polls. Walls to launch media blitz to woo male voters. Walls woo in dudes can only mean one thing. Fezin Hunts, football games, and Michael Strahan. When he comes to president Biden and the presidency, do you, would you, or do you see anything that you would have done there? Yeah, and look, as a governor, I was asked to be governor of this state when Donald Trump was president and when Joe Biden was there. I think the thing that drew me to this ticket and I think what the vice president's talking about is that her values on these hasn't changed. So it makes me want to ask you, do you think that Biden's done everything right? Well, look, I don't know if any of us do everything right, but I can tell you he's done everything in the best interest to the American public. Kamal is doing so badly with men that now she's just identifying as Biden. And it got worse. She said, I think all of us know that electoral college needs to go. But the campaign came out later that night, and I think that's not their stance. The campaign's position is clear, that that's not their position. Their position, and my position is to make sure that everybody understands their vote no matter what state they're in, matters. So that's something that you and my president here have disagree on? I have spoken about it in the past that she's been very clear on this and the campaign and my position is the campaign's position. The only thing clear about that was that coach wall spoke at a turn and the campaign benham over their knee and spanked them. This election isn't about men supporting women and black supporting Kamala. None of that identity politics matters. It's about making the country better. And if you've made it worse, and you say you're the same as the guy who made it that way and don't have a plan to fix it, then everything you're saying is just fluff. So when we think about what's at stake in this election, well, it's packed with some stuff. It's packed with some fundamental stuff. I say rather articulately. So we watched her speech so you don't have to. And we were waiting for her to tell us the fundamental stuff that's at stake. And she just told a long boring story about John McCain. Megan McCain, after tweeting, don't make me tell you what my father really thought about Kamala Harris. Meanwhile, on the Republican side, there's not a lot of scolding and bed wedding. What we see is quiet confidence. Trump's finishing this race in a disciplined manner, staying out of the media booby traps and connecting with new voters on a different level. I'm good with names, you know. You are. You're very good. You're a poker hauntist. Yeah. And there was, you tampon, Tim was good. It's hard to say. Yeah. And in other words, it's a mouthful. It's a lot. Yeah. And you can't stutter it through when you call it. It really allows you word to say. But it's quite accurate. When you put the names together, it's a little, you got to be able to pu- You got to be able to put it out there. Trump's winning the battle for men by being himself while Kamala is being somebody else, Joe Biden. And men weren't going to vote for Joe Biden either. That's why Barry Kudum. He was going to lose. And Kamala may lose now too. Don't blame that on American men. American men didn't blow up the border and break the dollar. A real man never would have done that. Real men accept responsibility for their actions. And Democrats couldn't do that. They couldn't let Biden run except the loss and try harder next election. They had to whack him and run Kamala. And now it's the same result for the same reason. Democrats have performance issues. And they need to get that treated.

And some of the black men that I have talked to have their reasons why they want to vote a different way. When less president Barack Obama is going to go out and lecture every other group of men from other identity groups, my message for Democrats is don't bring it here to black men who buy in large don't vote much differently from black women. No, sounds like Barry's in trouble with the ladies. So they're moving on to plan B. Slaping a helmet on coach walls and throwing him into the game to tackle white guys and drag him to the polls. Walls to launch media blitz to woo male voters. Walls woo in dudes can only mean one thing. Fezin Hunts, football games, and Michael Strahan. When he comes to president Biden and the presidency, do you, would you, or do you see anything that you would have done there? Yeah, and look, as a governor, I was asked to be governor of this state when Donald Trump was president and when Joe Biden was there. I think the thing that drew me to this ticket and I think what the vice president's talking about is that her values on these hasn't changed. So it makes me want to ask you, do you think that Biden's done everything right? Well, look, I don't know if any of us do everything right, but I can tell you he's done everything in the best interest to the American public. Kamal is doing so badly with men that now she's just identifying as Biden. And it got worse. She said, I think all of us know that electoral college needs to go. But the campaign came out later that night, and I think that's not their stance. The campaign's position is clear, that that's not their position. Their position, and my position is to make sure that everybody understands their vote no matter what state they're in, matters. So that's something that you and my president here have disagree on? I have spoken about it in the past that she's been very clear on this and the campaign and my position is the campaign's position. The only thing clear about that was that coach wall spoke at a turn and the campaign benham over their knee and spanked them. This election isn't about men supporting women and black supporting Kamala. None of that identity politics matters. It's about making the country better. And if you've made it worse, and you say you're the same as the guy who made it that way and don't have a plan to fix it, then everything you're saying is just fluff. So when we think about what's at stake in this election, well, it's packed with some stuff. It's packed with some fundamental stuff. I say rather articulately. So we watched her speech so you don't have to. And we were waiting for her to tell us the fundamental stuff that's at stake. And she just told a long boring story about John McCain. Megan McCain, after tweeting, don't make me tell you what my father really thought about Kamala Harris. Meanwhile, on the Republican side, there's not a lot of scolding and bed wedding. What we see is quiet confidence. Trump's finishing this race in a disciplined manner, staying out of the media booby traps and connecting with new voters on a different level. I'm good with names, you know. You are. You're very good. You're a poker hauntist. Yeah. And there was, you tampon, Tim was good. It's hard to say. Yeah. And in other words, it's a mouthful. It's a lot. Yeah. And you can't stutter it through when you call it. It really allows you word to say. But it's quite accurate. When you put the names together, it's a little, you got to be able to pu- You got to be able to put it out there. Trump's winning the battle for men by being himself while Kamala is being somebody else, Joe Biden. And men weren't going to vote for Joe Biden either. That's why Barry Kudum. He was going to lose. And Kamala may lose now too. Don't blame that on American men. American men didn't blow up the border and break the dollar. A real man never would have done that. Real men accept responsibility for their actions. And Democrats couldn't do that. They couldn't let Biden run except the loss and try harder next election. They had to whack him and run Kamala. And now it's the same result for the same reason. Democrats have performance issues. And they need to get that treated.

Eric Trump: 'It's shocking no one has talked about this',https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lLVXpd7Uiw,2024-10-11 17:30:00+00:00,Will George W. Bush endorse Kamala Harris?,0.6011144518852234," The moment to go, Governor Tim Walls, was pressed by Good Morning America about why Kamala Harris hasn't made good on her campaign promises while she's been in the White House. Here is that exchange. Something that former President Trump said, something that within your debate with, they were saying that, hey, the other policy that Kamala Harris could have done three years ago, which he was in, White House, what President Biden, if you never did. What do you say to people who bring that up? Well, Donald Trump had four years to do it if you're going to talk about that. What did you need a partner in Congress? You've seen these, we've seen different bills that are ready to pass. And Donald Trump makes sure he steps in. We saw it around immigration. A bipartisan bill widely respected, wanting to make a difference in this, holding true to our values, securing the border. Donald Trump steps in and says, look, that's going to hurt my political future. That's not make it happen. Oh gosh, well, they stopped with that. Donald Trump's son, Eric, who is EVP of the Trump Organization, joins us now to react. Good morning to Eric. Hey, ANC, how are you? Hey, I'm doing well, what did you make of that? Because everyone has been saying, she had three and a half years to do this, even your dad on the debate stage said that to her. And now they're flipping it and saying, well, he had four years. Yeah. Well, ANC, you can't answer a question if there's no answer to the question, right? Which is why he was trying to slide his way through that. I mean, at the end of the day, they let 20 million illegal immigrants into the country. And then you get to hear Kamala come out and talk about how she wants to fix the border. But she doesn't want to fix the border. And here's how you know why. My father built about 600 miles of wall. He also built the rest of the steel slats that all they needed to do was literally put up end. And she sold all of them for scrap metal. Then she goes out and they fly 320,000 illegal immigrants into the country. In the middle of the night, you guys covered it better than anybody. They were landing in airports all across the country. They're not serious about solving this problem. I mean, ANC, when was the last time you heard them talk about fentanyl? I mean, fentanyl has killed 300,000 children this year, 300,000. You have police departments in this country that are running out of Narcan. That's how much fentanyl. That's how big the problem has become. You don't hear them talking about it. ANC they want illegal immigrants. She was the border's are. My wife was just down on the border. The border patrol agents were literally telling her that they wouldn't allow them to turn on the security cameras that my father built, right on big poles right behind the wall. They wouldn't allow them to turn on the security cameras because they didn't want to show the American people the magnitude of the problem that they have on the southern border. And it's killing our country. It's killing our jobs. You see what's happening in Aurora, Colorado, where you have, then his whale and gang members taking over people's low income housing. I mean, you see it with a drug pandemic in this country. You see it with a human trafficking. You see it with jobs. I mean, you're taking every job. I mean, you're seeing real systematic problems. Right now in New York City, you have 157 hotels that are filled to the brim with illegal immigrants. These are the most expensive hotels anywhere on earth. And yet, we have veterans sleeping on streets. We're not doing anything to take care of them. We're not a serious administration. And the reason you have him do this rope adobe, Ainsley, is he can't answer the questions because their policies have been a disaster and they want these disastrous policies. You know, Eric, we're politics. You know this better than anyone. It's kind of what's going on in the times as to how we vote. And right now, we have, we saw what happened in Israel, broke everyone's hearts. We saw what happened in Afghanistan. We can't pay our groceries. We see all these illegal immigrants coming across our border. And then, we see that the problem is up. The list goes on and on. So when I see Kamala Harris drinking a beer, right when a hurricane is hitting the people we love in North Carolina and ripping down their houses and people are dying. Or when I see Tim Walls at a stadium talking about football, it's just not the right time for that. We're all anxious. We're all counting down until the selection. Everyone's nervous. People are scared they're going to lose our country. And they're having beers and talking about football and going fesent hunting. It's just not the time. This was the headline in Politico that Walls has to launch media blitz to woo male voters. There's a deficit among young men voting for Kamala Harris and for Walls. So he's trying to focus on football and hunting, doing this interview with Michael Strahan in the middle of the University of Minnesota football stadium, taking social influencers, hunting, fesent hunting, and taking local reporters, hunting or talking about hunting. What is your reaction to that? Yeah, my reaction is of course. Anzhi, she did a podcast called Call Her Daddy as a major hurricane was destroying our country. I mean, listen, I'm all for humor. You know me very well as a person, right? I'm a funny guy, but like wrong time, wrong place, no different than Biden sleeping on a beach on a Monday morning, right? I mean, sunbathing on a beach on a Monday morning, you know, wrong time. And of course, you know, Walls has to restore his reputation, you know, to the male voter. I mean, this is a guy who literally was putting tampons in males bathrooms in Minnesota. I mean, you know, I don't think there's many, you know, masculine men that exactly find that to be, you know, a positive attribute. I mean, this is a guy who took his honeymoon to China, shocking that no one talks about that. I mean, I'm still trying to figure out with Tim Walls, how a guy, you know, who is on a teacher salary, who is able to go over to China 35 times. Listen, I've been an international business my entire life. I know a lot of those guys. Who's been over to China 35 times? Who pays for those trips? Who takes their money? Who takes their honeymoon to communist China? And so, you know, I don't think you can restore your reputation by, you know, kind of haphazardly going in and field and pretending, you know, pretending you're a great hunter. I mean, first of all, you're going to look insincere, second of all, you're going to kind of look foolish because if you don't do it all the time, you can, you know, see it from a mile away. But, but man, I mean, I think it's going to take a lot of work. And I don't, I certainly don't think he can get there. Did you see what Obama said? He went to this campaign field office before he went to this rally and he said, it's not the same kind of energy as we saw when I was running. He's worried about the black male vote. Because everything's gone downhill. Anzli, there is a single person who's watching us right now. Go, go try and get auto insurance. Look at mortgage rates. You're getting 8% mortgage rates right now. When under my father was 2 and a half percent, right? I mean, look at the price of food. Gas is up three times utilities, the cost of an iPhone, the cost of your cell bill, the cost of your cable, the cost of rent in this country. No one thinks this world is doing better. No one thinks America is doing better. Our allies are being attacked. We're sending money overseas like drunken sailors, $200 billion to Ukraine. And FEMA runs out of money. FEMA, the last hurricane, we put $334 million into that hurricane. And my orcus comes out and says he's out of money. And yet we send $200 billion over to Ukraine. People understand we're not putting America first. We're putting America dead last. And it's just a sign of weakness. And my father will reverse that. My father will put this country first and we're going to win on the economy. And we're going to win on the military. And we're going to win on absolutely everything. And he's going to make America great again. Thank you, Eric. Great talking to you. I'm Steve Juicy. I'm Brian Killme.

'The Five': Is the Democrats blue wall crumbling?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-3qE6hJi5g,2024-10-11 00:00:34+00:00,Will Kamala Harris drop out of presidential race?,0.6884688138961792," Democrats, being beautiful blue wall might be crumbling, Axios out with a new piece on how Kamala's electoral college firewall is slipping away. It says, quote, top democratic politicians and operatives, tell us the vital states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are getting tougher for Vice President Harris and the party's Senate candidates. Democrats also say that Kamala's media blitz was a dud. Turns out, chugging brews with Colbert and helping Howard Stern cope with his Trump derangement syndrome didn't help move the needle. And even the Democrats, hype man, James Carville is sounding worried. Listen. I want to think I feel as the elections coming November 5th. I'm scared to death, and I'll get a time to beat up. Obviously, I'm happy. You're not in a reflective mood. Not in a particular reflective mood right now. I'm very very concerned about it. What does Harris need to do with the month left? They need to be sharp, they need to be aggressive, they need to stop answering questions and start asking questions. Would you like to see or do more press conferences? I'd like for to put more things in play. All right. I want to go to Jessica first, because it seems like this is an emotional issue for you. But I'm going to go to Greg instead. Greg. I want you to just ponder. Everything you just heard, Jessica. How concerned are the Democrats really, or is this just typical Democrats freaking out? I do think that you're seeing evidence of the media slowly turning on Harris because not of her politics or her lack of policies. It's that she appears to be losing. So it's like that's a different kind of political analysis. It's not like they're equally critical of Trump and Harris. When they criticize Trump, it's because they want him to lose. When they criticize Harris, it's because she's losing. They don't want it. It's weird though. You aren't seeing Republicans becoming Democrats, but you're seeing a lot of the reverse, you know, Hispanics, Blacks, young people. And it's because they realize they've been lied to so much about bigger issues. They've been manipulated, whether it was Russian inclusion, find people, hoax, drinking bleach, hunders laptop. I think they realized that their side, and they're going to find out everybody lies. But right now, they are finding out that their side lies. Pretty soon, that's the first level of awareness. And then when you get out of there, you're going to see, wow, everybody lies about everything. And then you're going to be free. That's a true, based, red pill. But if you look at what the Democrats focus on, it's removed from real life. You know, parents concerned about trans activism. They always side with the activists. They're concerned about men identifying as women and women sports. They side with the perverted grifters. When citizens are concerned about gas and food prices, they say it doesn't exist. Remember that? They said there's no inflation. And when they're concerned about crime, they say it's going down. So if you look at the two parties, you have one that is living in some fantasy land, and another one that is almost obsessed with reality. To a fault. Republicans are obsessed, like obsessed with reality, crime, immigration, inflation. That's as real as life gets. Dana, the polling numbers are still tight. They've been tight. I've still been confident for quite some time. All of a sudden, the Democrats don't seem confident. What has changed? I think they're all seeing the same things we're seeing, which is that the momentum is going in Trump's favor. And part of the reason is because Kamala Harris's media tour is having the inverse effect of what they wanted. The more people see here, the more they're thinking, wait, I don't think I can do this. The numbers are what they are. And for a long time, I believe that whoever this race ends up being about is the one that's going to lose. Because people know who Trump is. They might not like him, but they know his record. And they might think that, well, at least things were better back then. And if this is my choice, and I don't know her, but what I see of her, I'm not confident in, they won't have it. But it's not just the poll numbers. This was an astounding thing I noticed today, in all of my reading that I just did. Do you know how many Democrats are out there saying all these things she needs to do? Here's the smallest I just did this off the top of my head. They say, she needs to have another debate. That's not happening. She's doing more interviews. That's not happening. One said, she needs an energy plan. One said, she should do more town halls. I know she's got one or two, whatever. They said she needs to have an event specifically for Black men. Then she needs to have an event specifically for Latino men. And then she needs to be more interactive on the ground with the voters. And she needs to do more fundraising. And on and on. And every article I'm reading, that's all the things that she should do, that she can't do. It's like when Harold would sit here and say, Joe Biden should come out and say this, or he should do this. And he's like, Harold, that's not happening. Yeah, it's true, Harold. This is like, in your face. It's three, yeah, in your face, Harold. You're not even here. There's three weeks left with a campaign. When do they think she's going to do this? And I think all of them are doing this right now to be on record. As saying, I told you, yes. Right, Charles Blow, for example, in the New York Times today saying there's all the things she needs to do. She's not going to do those. Jay Mart also in the New York Times, Danae. Oh my gosh, there was a whole, no, no, political magazine. Same thing. No, no. No. It's so close. I read the whole thing of all the things that she should do and that's to get on record because they think she's going to lose right now. So, Judge, when the Democrats are giving advice to the top Democrat, that's when you know they're losing. Well, think about it. She made history by raising $1 billion in 80 days for a presidential candidate. That's unbelievable. And that's going to dampen the fundraising, OK? And I understand that it's so close in Pennsylvania that she's going to spend $350 million on ads in Pennsylvania. But here's the thing. We talk about, they're supposed to be that beautiful blue wall. Kamala was supposed to be the sure fire winner. But we weren't supposed to know that she couldn't speak or she couldn't respond or she couldn't do an interview. We weren't supposed to know that because Donald Trump was supposed to be in jail or worse. And that was the thinking. We were never supposed to know how inept she is at all of this, whether it's signifying or conveying a sense of empathy. Now, also, this whole idea, she took for granted. She takes for granted the blacks and the minorities as well as the blue collar worker. And with the realignment of this group with Republicans, because the Republicans are now the party of the working class, they're not trusting her. She's the one who said the border was secure. You know, she's the one who told them that there's really no inflation. And finally, this whole idea, she's trying to get men back by saying that M.H.H. and Waltz, they're really, that's true masculinity. I dare you to take a poll and put together Donald Trump and JD Vance against M.H.H. and Waltz and ask who's going to win in terms of masculinity. They even have to redefine it. Americans aren't feeling it. I don't think you want that competition. People, I mean, he has beautiful eyelashes, but JD Vance looks like he's wearing eyeliner most at the time. What do you snag? I'm terribly nervous. I know. And maybe the couch story was real. And you know what, Sethi was in, you know, carrying weapons of war. He was in background. You want to talk about it? A working class fame on his golden toilet. Let's not do this again. So you are correct. The premise of your question, Jesse, we like being scared. We run better when we're scared. This is our comfort state. And I'm thankful to be in this position versus your red wave vibe that you had before it all came crashing down. Would you rather be Donald Trump right now? Or would you rather be Kamala Harris? I would never rather be Trump. You know what I'm talking about. In this position, would you rather be Trump or her? The reason that I would rather be Kamala Harris is that he has to depend on low propensity voters to show up. And she has to depend on high propensity voters to show up. She has to convert people to voting for her. She has to get those moderate Republicans. But Donald Trump needs to be on the Joe Rogan circuit or the Andrew Schultz circuit to get people who don't typically show. And that's a steeper challenge. That's my honest answer. I think you like it. You're making a good face. I just can't argue with it because I don't want to. OK. Great. So I'll handle it. OK. OK. So for all of that... Great. Well, you take this one for me. Yeah. She's wearing me down. For all of the good news that there has been for Trump, and it definitely has felt like a vibe shift this week. He still only gained 0.3 points in the polls. And Nate Silver was tweeting about that today. And there were some really interesting things in the New York Times, the Anna polls. And not only was she up four points in that I'd been one of her worst polls, but now abortion is in the top three issues. And we know if abortion is in the top three issues that that favors Democrats. They also found that Kamala has support from 93% of Democrats. But Donald Trump only has support from 80% of Republicans. But there's more Republicans in Democrats. But Republicans in Democrats. OK. But actually... I didn't hear what you said, Dana. She said there are more Republicans than Democrats, and we can talk about that, but it doesn't mean they're necessarily being affiliated, it doesn't mean that you're going to vote that way. And Blueprint had a new survey out where they found that 36% of Nikki Haley's voters are going to back Harris. Only 49% of the Republican Haley voters are going to back Trump down from 64% in 2020. A lot of numbers, Jessica. A lot of numbers. Yeah, that's how elections work. A shy, a lot of votes. There might be or a loud one. And like in Wisconsin, where she appeared with Liz Cheney, the biggest group of undecided voters are moderate and Republican leaning undecided. And so you bring Liz Cheney out there. The Adam Kinzenger's of the world. Oh, God. Oh, the Arab cry. You guys... Is it going to cry if she doesn't win? If she's depending on Cheney and Kinzenger, I think there's things... What's his name? I'm sorry. Constance again. You're not sorry. Kinzenger. It's a hard name to pronounce. It's not Kinzenger. And it's Jonathan Martin, not J. Hart. That jerk, girl. Who can hear her? No one cares about him. I'm sorry. That's your favorite thing to say. I'm not sorry. It's true, though. It's true. It's Marjorie Taylor Green. Who's that? Jessica, okay. We gave you your time.

And with the realignment of this group with Republicans, because the Republicans are now the party of the working class, they're not trusting her. She's the one who said the border was secure. You know, she's the one who told them that there's really no inflation. And finally, this whole idea, she's trying to get men back by saying that M.H.H. and Waltz, they're really, that's true masculinity. I dare you to take a poll and put together Donald Trump and JD Vance against M.H.H. and Waltz and ask who's going to win in terms of masculinity. They even have to redefine it. Americans aren't feeling it. I don't think you want that competition. People, I mean, he has beautiful eyelashes, but JD Vance looks like he's wearing eyeliner most at the time. What do you snag? I'm terribly nervous. I know. And maybe the couch story was real. And you know what, Sethi was in, you know, carrying weapons of war. He was in background. You want to talk about it? A working class fame on his golden toilet. Let's not do this again. So you are correct. The premise of your question, Jesse, we like being scared. We run better when we're scared. This is our comfort state. And I'm thankful to be in this position versus your red wave vibe that you had before it all came crashing down. Would you rather be Donald Trump right now? Or would you rather be Kamala Harris? I would never rather be Trump. You know what I'm talking about. In this position, would you rather be Trump or her? The reason that I would rather be Kamala Harris is that he has to depend on low propensity voters to show up. And she has to depend on high propensity voters to show up. She has to convert people to voting for her. She has to get those moderate Republicans. But Donald Trump needs to be on the Joe Rogan circuit or the Andrew Schultz circuit to get people who don't typically show. And that's a steeper challenge. That's my honest answer. I think you like it. You're making a good face. I just can't argue with it because I don't want to. OK. Great. So I'll handle it. OK. OK. So for all of that... Great. Well, you take this one for me. Yeah. She's wearing me down. For all of the good news that there has been for Trump, and it definitely has felt like a vibe shift this week. He still only gained 0.3 points in the polls. And Nate Silver was tweeting about that today. And there were some really interesting things in the New York Times, the Anna polls. And not only was she up four points in that I'd been one of her worst polls, but now abortion is in the top three issues. And we know if abortion is in the top three issues that that favors Democrats. They also found that Kamala has support from 93% of Democrats. But Donald Trump only has support from 80% of Republicans. But there's more Republicans in Democrats. But Republicans in Democrats. OK. But actually... I didn't hear what you said, Dana. She said there are more Republicans than Democrats, and we can talk about that, but it doesn't mean they're necessarily being affiliated, it doesn't mean that you're going to vote that way. And Blueprint had a new survey out where they found that 36% of Nikki Haley's voters are going to back Harris. Only 49% of the Republican Haley voters are going to back Trump down from 64% in 2020. A lot of numbers, Jessica. A lot of numbers. Yeah, that's how elections work. A shy, a lot of votes. There might be or a loud one. And like in Wisconsin, where she appeared with Liz Cheney, the biggest group of undecided voters are moderate and Republican leaning undecided. And so you bring Liz Cheney out there. The Adam Kinzenger's of the world. Oh, God. Oh, the Arab cry. You guys... Is it going to cry if she doesn't win? If she's depending on Cheney and Kinzenger, I think there's things... What's his name? I'm sorry. Constance again. You're not sorry. Kinzenger. It's a hard name to pronounce. It's not Kinzenger. And it's Jonathan Martin, not J. Hart. That jerk, girl. Who can hear her? No one cares about him. I'm sorry. That's your favorite thing to say. I'm not sorry. It's true, though. It's true. It's Marjorie Taylor Green. Who's that? Jessica, okay. We gave you your time.

'The Five': Is the Democrats blue wall crumbling?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-3qE6hJi5g,2024-10-11 00:00:34+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win all 6 swing states?,0.657521665096283," Democrats, being beautiful blue wall might be crumbling, Axios out with a new piece on how Kamala's electoral college firewall is slipping away. It says, quote, top democratic politicians and operatives, tell us the vital states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are getting tougher for Vice President Harris and the party's Senate candidates. Democrats also say that Kamala's media blitz was a dud. Turns out, chugging brews with Colbert and helping Howard Stern cope with his Trump derangement syndrome didn't help move the needle. And even the Democrats, hype man, James Carville is sounding worried. Listen. I want to think I feel as the elections coming November 5th. I'm scared to death, and I'll get a time to beat up. Obviously, I'm happy. You're not in a reflective mood. Not in a particular reflective mood right now. I'm very very concerned about it. What does Harris need to do with the month left? They need to be sharp, they need to be aggressive, they need to stop answering questions and start asking questions. Would you like to see or do more press conferences? I'd like for to put more things in play. All right. I want to go to Jessica first, because it seems like this is an emotional issue for you. But I'm going to go to Greg instead. Greg. I want you to just ponder. Everything you just heard, Jessica. How concerned are the Democrats really, or is this just typical Democrats freaking out? I do think that you're seeing evidence of the media slowly turning on Harris because not of her politics or her lack of policies. It's that she appears to be losing. So it's like that's a different kind of political analysis. It's not like they're equally critical of Trump and Harris. When they criticize Trump, it's because they want him to lose. When they criticize Harris, it's because she's losing. They don't want it. It's weird though. You aren't seeing Republicans becoming Democrats, but you're seeing a lot of the reverse, you know, Hispanics, Blacks, young people. And it's because they realize they've been lied to so much about bigger issues. They've been manipulated, whether it was Russian inclusion, find people, hoax, drinking bleach, hunders laptop. I think they realized that their side, and they're going to find out everybody lies. But right now, they are finding out that their side lies. Pretty soon, that's the first level of awareness. And then when you get out of there, you're going to see, wow, everybody lies about everything. And then you're going to be free. That's a true, based, red pill. But if you look at what the Democrats focus on, it's removed from real life. You know, parents concerned about trans activism. They always side with the activists. They're concerned about men identifying as women and women sports. They side with the perverted grifters. When citizens are concerned about gas and food prices, they say it doesn't exist. Remember that? They said there's no inflation. And when they're concerned about crime, they say it's going down. So if you look at the two parties, you have one that is living in some fantasy land, and another one that is almost obsessed with reality. To a fault. Republicans are obsessed, like obsessed with reality, crime, immigration, inflation. That's as real as life gets. Dana, the polling numbers are still tight. They've been tight. I've still been confident for quite some time. All of a sudden, the Democrats don't seem confident. What has changed? I think they're all seeing the same things we're seeing, which is that the momentum is going in Trump's favor. And part of the reason is because Kamala Harris's media tour is having the inverse effect of what they wanted. The more people see here, the more they're thinking, wait, I don't think I can do this. The numbers are what they are. And for a long time, I believe that whoever this race ends up being about is the one that's going to lose. Because people know who Trump is. They might not like him, but they know his record. And they might think that, well, at least things were better back then. And if this is my choice, and I don't know her, but what I see of her, I'm not confident in, they won't have it. But it's not just the poll numbers. This was an astounding thing I noticed today, in all of my reading that I just did. Do you know how many Democrats are out there saying all these things she needs to do? Here's the smallest I just did this off the top of my head. They say, she needs to have another debate. That's not happening. She's doing more interviews. That's not happening. One said, she needs an energy plan. One said, she should do more town halls. I know she's got one or two, whatever. They said she needs to have an event specifically for Black men. Then she needs to have an event specifically for Latino men. And then she needs to be more interactive on the ground with the voters. And she needs to do more fundraising. And on and on. And every article I'm reading, that's all the things that she should do, that she can't do. It's like when Harold would sit here and say, Joe Biden should come out and say this, or he should do this. And he's like, Harold, that's not happening. Yeah, it's true, Harold. This is like, in your face. It's three, yeah, in your face, Harold. You're not even here. There's three weeks left with a campaign. When do they think she's going to do this? And I think all of them are doing this right now to be on record. As saying, I told you, yes. Right, Charles Blow, for example, in the New York Times today saying there's all the things she needs to do. She's not going to do those. Jay Mart also in the New York Times, Danae. Oh my gosh, there was a whole, no, no, political magazine. Same thing. No, no. No. It's so close. I read the whole thing of all the things that she should do and that's to get on record because they think she's going to lose right now. So, Judge, when the Democrats are giving advice to the top Democrat, that's when you know they're losing. Well, think about it. She made history by raising $1 billion in 80 days for a presidential candidate. That's unbelievable. And that's going to dampen the fundraising, OK? And I understand that it's so close in Pennsylvania that she's going to spend $350 million on ads in Pennsylvania. But here's the thing. We talk about, they're supposed to be that beautiful blue wall. Kamala was supposed to be the sure fire winner. But we weren't supposed to know that she couldn't speak or she couldn't respond or she couldn't do an interview. We weren't supposed to know that because Donald Trump was supposed to be in jail or worse. And that was the thinking. We were never supposed to know how inept she is at all of this, whether it's signifying or conveying a sense of empathy. Now, also, this whole idea, she took for granted. She takes for granted the blacks and the minorities as well as the blue collar worker.

The numbers are what they are. And for a long time, I believe that whoever this race ends up being about is the one that's going to lose. Because people know who Trump is. They might not like him, but they know his record. And they might think that, well, at least things were better back then. And if this is my choice, and I don't know her, but what I see of her, I'm not confident in, they won't have it. But it's not just the poll numbers. This was an astounding thing I noticed today, in all of my reading that I just did. Do you know how many Democrats are out there saying all these things she needs to do? Here's the smallest I just did this off the top of my head. They say, she needs to have another debate. That's not happening. She's doing more interviews. That's not happening. One said, she needs an energy plan. One said, she should do more town halls. I know she's got one or two, whatever. They said she needs to have an event specifically for Black men. Then she needs to have an event specifically for Latino men. And then she needs to be more interactive on the ground with the voters. And she needs to do more fundraising. And on and on. And every article I'm reading, that's all the things that she should do, that she can't do. It's like when Harold would sit here and say, Joe Biden should come out and say this, or he should do this. And he's like, Harold, that's not happening. Yeah, it's true, Harold. This is like, in your face. It's three, yeah, in your face, Harold. You're not even here. There's three weeks left with a campaign. When do they think she's going to do this? And I think all of them are doing this right now to be on record. As saying, I told you, yes. Right, Charles Blow, for example, in the New York Times today saying there's all the things she needs to do. She's not going to do those. Jay Mart also in the New York Times, Danae. Oh my gosh, there was a whole, no, no, political magazine. Same thing. No, no. No. It's so close. I read the whole thing of all the things that she should do and that's to get on record because they think she's going to lose right now. So, Judge, when the Democrats are giving advice to the top Democrat, that's when you know they're losing. Well, think about it. She made history by raising $1 billion in 80 days for a presidential candidate. That's unbelievable. And that's going to dampen the fundraising, OK? And I understand that it's so close in Pennsylvania that she's going to spend $350 million on ads in Pennsylvania. But here's the thing. We talk about, they're supposed to be that beautiful blue wall. Kamala was supposed to be the sure fire winner. But we weren't supposed to know that she couldn't speak or she couldn't respond or she couldn't do an interview. We weren't supposed to know that because Donald Trump was supposed to be in jail or worse. And that was the thinking. We were never supposed to know how inept she is at all of this, whether it's signifying or conveying a sense of empathy. Now, also, this whole idea, she took for granted. She takes for granted the blacks and the minorities as well as the blue collar worker. And with the realignment of this group with Republicans, because the Republicans are now the party of the working class, they're not trusting her. She's the one who said the border was secure. You know, she's the one who told them that there's really no inflation. And finally, this whole idea, she's trying to get men back by saying that M.H.H. and Waltz, they're really, that's true masculinity. I dare you to take a poll and put together Donald Trump and JD Vance against M.H.H. and Waltz and ask who's going to win in terms of masculinity. They even have to redefine it. Americans aren't feeling it. I don't think you want that competition. People, I mean, he has beautiful eyelashes, but JD Vance looks like he's wearing eyeliner most at the time. What do you snag? I'm terribly nervous. I know. And maybe the couch story was real. And you know what, Sethi was in, you know, carrying weapons of war. He was in background. You want to talk about it? A working class fame on his golden toilet. Let's not do this again. So you are correct. The premise of your question, Jesse, we like being scared. We run better when we're scared. This is our comfort state. And I'm thankful to be in this position versus your red wave vibe that you had before it all came crashing down. Would you rather be Donald Trump right now? Or would you rather be Kamala Harris? I would never rather be Trump. You know what I'm talking about. In this position, would you rather be Trump or her? The reason that I would rather be Kamala Harris is that he has to depend on low propensity voters to show up. And she has to depend on high propensity voters to show up. She has to convert people to voting for her. She has to get those moderate Republicans. But Donald Trump needs to be on the Joe Rogan circuit or the Andrew Schultz circuit to get people who don't typically show. And that's a steeper challenge. That's my honest answer. I think you like it. You're making a good face. I just can't argue with it because I don't want to. OK. Great. So I'll handle it. OK. OK. So for all of that... Great. Well, you take this one for me. Yeah. She's wearing me down. For all of the good news that there has been for Trump, and it definitely has felt like a vibe shift this week. He still only gained 0.3 points in the polls. And Nate Silver was tweeting about that today. And there were some really interesting things in the New York Times, the Anna polls. And not only was she up four points in that I'd been one of her worst polls, but now abortion is in the top three issues. And we know if abortion is in the top three issues that that favors Democrats. They also found that Kamala has support from 93% of Democrats. But Donald Trump only has support from 80% of Republicans. But there's more Republicans in Democrats. But Republicans in Democrats. OK. But actually... I didn't hear what you said, Dana. She said there are more Republicans than Democrats, and we can talk about that, but it doesn't mean they're necessarily being affiliated, it doesn't mean that you're going to vote that way. And Blueprint had a new survey out where they found that 36% of Nikki Haley's voters are going to back Harris. Only 49% of the Republican Haley voters are going to back Trump down from 64% in 2020. A lot of numbers, Jessica. A lot of numbers. Yeah, that's how elections work. A shy, a lot of votes. There might be or a loud one. And like in Wisconsin, where she appeared with Liz Cheney, the biggest group of undecided voters are moderate and Republican leaning undecided. And so you bring Liz Cheney out there. The Adam Kinzenger's of the world. Oh, God. Oh, the Arab cry. You guys... Is it going to cry if she doesn't win? If she's depending on Cheney and Kinzenger, I think there's things... What's his name? I'm sorry. Constance again. You're not sorry. Kinzenger. It's a hard name to pronounce. It's not Kinzenger. And it's Jonathan Martin, not J. Hart. That jerk, girl. Who can hear her? No one cares about him. I'm sorry. That's your favorite thing to say. I'm not sorry. It's true, though. It's true. It's Marjorie Taylor Green. Who's that? Jessica, okay. We gave you your time.

'The Five': Is the Democrats blue wall crumbling?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-3qE6hJi5g,2024-10-11 00:00:34+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win another state by the largest margin?,0.6431617140769958," Democrats, being beautiful blue wall might be crumbling, Axios out with a new piece on how Kamala's electoral college firewall is slipping away. It says, quote, top democratic politicians and operatives, tell us the vital states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are getting tougher for Vice President Harris and the party's Senate candidates. Democrats also say that Kamala's media blitz was a dud. Turns out, chugging brews with Colbert and helping Howard Stern cope with his Trump derangement syndrome didn't help move the needle. And even the Democrats, hype man, James Carville is sounding worried. Listen. I want to think I feel as the elections coming November 5th. I'm scared to death, and I'll get a time to beat up. Obviously, I'm happy. You're not in a reflective mood. Not in a particular reflective mood right now. I'm very very concerned about it. What does Harris need to do with the month left? They need to be sharp, they need to be aggressive, they need to stop answering questions and start asking questions. Would you like to see or do more press conferences? I'd like for to put more things in play. All right. I want to go to Jessica first, because it seems like this is an emotional issue for you. But I'm going to go to Greg instead. Greg. I want you to just ponder. Everything you just heard, Jessica. How concerned are the Democrats really, or is this just typical Democrats freaking out? I do think that you're seeing evidence of the media slowly turning on Harris because not of her politics or her lack of policies. It's that she appears to be losing. So it's like that's a different kind of political analysis. It's not like they're equally critical of Trump and Harris. When they criticize Trump, it's because they want him to lose. When they criticize Harris, it's because she's losing. They don't want it. It's weird though. You aren't seeing Republicans becoming Democrats, but you're seeing a lot of the reverse, you know, Hispanics, Blacks, young people. And it's because they realize they've been lied to so much about bigger issues. They've been manipulated, whether it was Russian inclusion, find people, hoax, drinking bleach, hunders laptop. I think they realized that their side, and they're going to find out everybody lies. But right now, they are finding out that their side lies. Pretty soon, that's the first level of awareness. And then when you get out of there, you're going to see, wow, everybody lies about everything. And then you're going to be free. That's a true, based, red pill. But if you look at what the Democrats focus on, it's removed from real life. You know, parents concerned about trans activism. They always side with the activists. They're concerned about men identifying as women and women sports. They side with the perverted grifters. When citizens are concerned about gas and food prices, they say it doesn't exist. Remember that? They said there's no inflation. And when they're concerned about crime, they say it's going down. So if you look at the two parties, you have one that is living in some fantasy land, and another one that is almost obsessed with reality. To a fault. Republicans are obsessed, like obsessed with reality, crime, immigration, inflation. That's as real as life gets. Dana, the polling numbers are still tight. They've been tight. I've still been confident for quite some time. All of a sudden, the Democrats don't seem confident. What has changed? I think they're all seeing the same things we're seeing, which is that the momentum is going in Trump's favor.

Democrats also say that Kamala's media blitz was a dud. Turns out, chugging brews with Colbert and helping Howard Stern cope with his Trump derangement syndrome didn't help move the needle. And even the Democrats, hype man, James Carville is sounding worried. Listen. I want to think I feel as the elections coming November 5th. I'm scared to death, and I'll get a time to beat up. Obviously, I'm happy. You're not in a reflective mood. Not in a particular reflective mood right now. I'm very very concerned about it. What does Harris need to do with the month left? They need to be sharp, they need to be aggressive, they need to stop answering questions and start asking questions. Would you like to see or do more press conferences? I'd like for to put more things in play. All right. I want to go to Jessica first, because it seems like this is an emotional issue for you. But I'm going to go to Greg instead. Greg. I want you to just ponder. Everything you just heard, Jessica. How concerned are the Democrats really, or is this just typical Democrats freaking out? I do think that you're seeing evidence of the media slowly turning on Harris because not of her politics or her lack of policies. It's that she appears to be losing. So it's like that's a different kind of political analysis. It's not like they're equally critical of Trump and Harris. When they criticize Trump, it's because they want him to lose. When they criticize Harris, it's because she's losing. They don't want it. It's weird though. You aren't seeing Republicans becoming Democrats, but you're seeing a lot of the reverse, you know, Hispanics, Blacks, young people. And it's because they realize they've been lied to so much about bigger issues. They've been manipulated, whether it was Russian inclusion, find people, hoax, drinking bleach, hunders laptop. I think they realized that their side, and they're going to find out everybody lies. But right now, they are finding out that their side lies. Pretty soon, that's the first level of awareness. And then when you get out of there, you're going to see, wow, everybody lies about everything. And then you're going to be free. That's a true, based, red pill. But if you look at what the Democrats focus on, it's removed from real life. You know, parents concerned about trans activism. They always side with the activists. They're concerned about men identifying as women and women sports. They side with the perverted grifters. When citizens are concerned about gas and food prices, they say it doesn't exist. Remember that? They said there's no inflation. And when they're concerned about crime, they say it's going down. So if you look at the two parties, you have one that is living in some fantasy land, and another one that is almost obsessed with reality. To a fault. Republicans are obsessed, like obsessed with reality, crime, immigration, inflation. That's as real as life gets. Dana, the polling numbers are still tight. They've been tight. I've still been confident for quite some time. All of a sudden, the Democrats don't seem confident. What has changed? I think they're all seeing the same things we're seeing, which is that the momentum is going in Trump's favor. And part of the reason is because Kamala Harris's media tour is having the inverse effect of what they wanted. The more people see here, the more they're thinking, wait, I don't think I can do this. The numbers are what they are. And for a long time, I believe that whoever this race ends up being about is the one that's going to lose. Because people know who Trump is. They might not like him, but they know his record. And they might think that, well, at least things were better back then. And if this is my choice, and I don't know her, but what I see of her, I'm not confident in, they won't have it. But it's not just the poll numbers. This was an astounding thing I noticed today, in all of my reading that I just did. Do you know how many Democrats are out there saying all these things she needs to do? Here's the smallest I just did this off the top of my head. They say, she needs to have another debate. That's not happening. She's doing more interviews. That's not happening. One said, she needs an energy plan. One said, she should do more town halls. I know she's got one or two, whatever. They said she needs to have an event specifically for Black men. Then she needs to have an event specifically for Latino men. And then she needs to be more interactive on the ground with the voters. And she needs to do more fundraising. And on and on. And every article I'm reading, that's all the things that she should do, that she can't do. It's like when Harold would sit here and say, Joe Biden should come out and say this, or he should do this. And he's like, Harold, that's not happening. Yeah, it's true, Harold. This is like, in your face. It's three, yeah, in your face, Harold. You're not even here. There's three weeks left with a campaign. When do they think she's going to do this? And I think all of them are doing this right now to be on record. As saying, I told you, yes. Right, Charles Blow, for example, in the New York Times today saying there's all the things she needs to do. She's not going to do those. Jay Mart also in the New York Times, Danae. Oh my gosh, there was a whole, no, no, political magazine. Same thing. No, no. No. It's so close. I read the whole thing of all the things that she should do and that's to get on record because they think she's going to lose right now. So, Judge, when the Democrats are giving advice to the top Democrat, that's when you know they're losing. Well, think about it. She made history by raising $1 billion in 80 days for a presidential candidate. That's unbelievable. And that's going to dampen the fundraising, OK? And I understand that it's so close in Pennsylvania that she's going to spend $350 million on ads in Pennsylvania. But here's the thing. We talk about, they're supposed to be that beautiful blue wall. Kamala was supposed to be the sure fire winner. But we weren't supposed to know that she couldn't speak or she couldn't respond or she couldn't do an interview. We weren't supposed to know that because Donald Trump was supposed to be in jail or worse. And that was the thinking. We were never supposed to know how inept she is at all of this, whether it's signifying or conveying a sense of empathy. Now, also, this whole idea, she took for granted. She takes for granted the blacks and the minorities as well as the blue collar worker. And with the realignment of this group with Republicans, because the Republicans are now the party of the working class, they're not trusting her. She's the one who said the border was secure. You know, she's the one who told them that there's really no inflation. And finally, this whole idea, she's trying to get men back by saying that M.H.H. and Waltz, they're really, that's true masculinity. I dare you to take a poll and put together Donald Trump and JD Vance against M.H.H. and Waltz and ask who's going to win in terms of masculinity. They even have to redefine it. Americans aren't feeling it. I don't think you want that competition. People, I mean, he has beautiful eyelashes, but JD Vance looks like he's wearing eyeliner most at the time. What do you snag? I'm terribly nervous. I know. And maybe the couch story was real. And you know what, Sethi was in, you know, carrying weapons of war. He was in background. You want to talk about it? A working class fame on his golden toilet. Let's not do this again. So you are correct. The premise of your question, Jesse, we like being scared. We run better when we're scared. This is our comfort state. And I'm thankful to be in this position versus your red wave vibe that you had before it all came crashing down. Would you rather be Donald Trump right now? Or would you rather be Kamala Harris? I would never rather be Trump. You know what I'm talking about. In this position, would you rather be Trump or her? The reason that I would rather be Kamala Harris is that he has to depend on low propensity voters to show up. And she has to depend on high propensity voters to show up. She has to convert people to voting for her. She has to get those moderate Republicans. But Donald Trump needs to be on the Joe Rogan circuit or the Andrew Schultz circuit to get people who don't typically show. And that's a steeper challenge. That's my honest answer. I think you like it. You're making a good face. I just can't argue with it because I don't want to. OK. Great. So I'll handle it. OK. OK. So for all of that... Great. Well, you take this one for me. Yeah. She's wearing me down. For all of the good news that there has been for Trump, and it definitely has felt like a vibe shift this week. He still only gained 0.3 points in the polls. And Nate Silver was tweeting about that today. And there were some really interesting things in the New York Times, the Anna polls. And not only was she up four points in that I'd been one of her worst polls, but now abortion is in the top three issues. And we know if abortion is in the top three issues that that favors Democrats. They also found that Kamala has support from 93% of Democrats. But Donald Trump only has support from 80% of Republicans. But there's more Republicans in Democrats. But Republicans in Democrats. OK. But actually... I didn't hear what you said, Dana. She said there are more Republicans than Democrats, and we can talk about that, but it doesn't mean they're necessarily being affiliated, it doesn't mean that you're going to vote that way. And Blueprint had a new survey out where they found that 36% of Nikki Haley's voters are going to back Harris. Only 49% of the Republican Haley voters are going to back Trump down from 64% in 2020. A lot of numbers, Jessica. A lot of numbers. Yeah, that's how elections work. A shy, a lot of votes. There might be or a loud one. And like in Wisconsin, where she appeared with Liz Cheney, the biggest group of undecided voters are moderate and Republican leaning undecided. And so you bring Liz Cheney out there. The Adam Kinzenger's of the world. Oh, God. Oh, the Arab cry. You guys... Is it going to cry if she doesn't win? If she's depending on Cheney and Kinzenger, I think there's things... What's his name? I'm sorry. Constance again. You're not sorry. Kinzenger. It's a hard name to pronounce. It's not Kinzenger. And it's Jonathan Martin, not J. Hart. That jerk, girl. Who can hear her? No one cares about him. I'm sorry. That's your favorite thing to say. I'm not sorry. It's true, though. It's true. It's Marjorie Taylor Green. Who's that? Jessica, okay. We gave you your time. Please let's sell some ads. I... I had a Dougie Dining Dash. Tim Walls and Doug M. Off Grab Coffee and walk away without paying.

The reason that I would rather be Kamala Harris is that he has to depend on low propensity voters to show up. And she has to depend on high propensity voters to show up. She has to convert people to voting for her. She has to get those moderate Republicans. But Donald Trump needs to be on the Joe Rogan circuit or the Andrew Schultz circuit to get people who don't typically show. And that's a steeper challenge. That's my honest answer. I think you like it. You're making a good face. I just can't argue with it because I don't want to. OK. Great. So I'll handle it. OK. OK. So for all of that... Great. Well, you take this one for me. Yeah. She's wearing me down. For all of the good news that there has been for Trump, and it definitely has felt like a vibe shift this week. He still only gained 0.3 points in the polls. And Nate Silver was tweeting about that today. And there were some really interesting things in the New York Times, the Anna polls. And not only was she up four points in that I'd been one of her worst polls, but now abortion is in the top three issues. And we know if abortion is in the top three issues that that favors Democrats. They also found that Kamala has support from 93% of Democrats. But Donald Trump only has support from 80% of Republicans. But there's more Republicans in Democrats. But Republicans in Democrats. OK. But actually... I didn't hear what you said, Dana. She said there are more Republicans than Democrats, and we can talk about that, but it doesn't mean they're necessarily being affiliated, it doesn't mean that you're going to vote that way. And Blueprint had a new survey out where they found that 36% of Nikki Haley's voters are going to back Harris. Only 49% of the Republican Haley voters are going to back Trump down from 64% in 2020. A lot of numbers, Jessica. A lot of numbers. Yeah, that's how elections work. A shy, a lot of votes. There might be or a loud one. And like in Wisconsin, where she appeared with Liz Cheney, the biggest group of undecided voters are moderate and Republican leaning undecided. And so you bring Liz Cheney out there. The Adam Kinzenger's of the world. Oh, God. Oh, the Arab cry. You guys... Is it going to cry if she doesn't win? If she's depending on Cheney and Kinzenger, I think there's things... What's his name? I'm sorry. Constance again. You're not sorry. Kinzenger. It's a hard name to pronounce. It's not Kinzenger. And it's Jonathan Martin, not J. Hart. That jerk, girl. Who can hear her? No one cares about him. I'm sorry. That's your favorite thing to say. I'm not sorry. It's true, though. It's true. It's Marjorie Taylor Green. Who's that? Jessica, okay. We gave you your time.

'The Five': Is the Democrats blue wall crumbling?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-3qE6hJi5g,2024-10-11 00:00:34+00:00,Kamala Harris wins a solid red state?,0.6136469841003418," Democrats, being beautiful blue wall might be crumbling, Axios out with a new piece on how Kamala's electoral college firewall is slipping away. It says, quote, top democratic politicians and operatives, tell us the vital states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are getting tougher for Vice President Harris and the party's Senate candidates. Democrats also say that Kamala's media blitz was a dud. Turns out, chugging brews with Colbert and helping Howard Stern cope with his Trump derangement syndrome didn't help move the needle. And even the Democrats, hype man, James Carville is sounding worried. Listen. I want to think I feel as the elections coming November 5th. I'm scared to death, and I'll get a time to beat up. Obviously, I'm happy. You're not in a reflective mood. Not in a particular reflective mood right now. I'm very very concerned about it. What does Harris need to do with the month left? They need to be sharp, they need to be aggressive, they need to stop answering questions and start asking questions. Would you like to see or do more press conferences? I'd like for to put more things in play. All right. I want to go to Jessica first, because it seems like this is an emotional issue for you. But I'm going to go to Greg instead. Greg. I want you to just ponder. Everything you just heard, Jessica. How concerned are the Democrats really, or is this just typical Democrats freaking out? I do think that you're seeing evidence of the media slowly turning on Harris because not of her politics or her lack of policies. It's that she appears to be losing. So it's like that's a different kind of political analysis. It's not like they're equally critical of Trump and Harris. When they criticize Trump, it's because they want him to lose. When they criticize Harris, it's because she's losing. They don't want it. It's weird though. You aren't seeing Republicans becoming Democrats, but you're seeing a lot of the reverse, you know, Hispanics, Blacks, young people. And it's because they realize they've been lied to so much about bigger issues. They've been manipulated, whether it was Russian inclusion, find people, hoax, drinking bleach, hunders laptop. I think they realized that their side, and they're going to find out everybody lies. But right now, they are finding out that their side lies. Pretty soon, that's the first level of awareness. And then when you get out of there, you're going to see, wow, everybody lies about everything. And then you're going to be free. That's a true, based, red pill. But if you look at what the Democrats focus on, it's removed from real life. You know, parents concerned about trans activism. They always side with the activists. They're concerned about men identifying as women and women sports. They side with the perverted grifters. When citizens are concerned about gas and food prices, they say it doesn't exist. Remember that? They said there's no inflation. And when they're concerned about crime, they say it's going down. So if you look at the two parties, you have one that is living in some fantasy land, and another one that is almost obsessed with reality. To a fault. Republicans are obsessed, like obsessed with reality, crime, immigration, inflation. That's as real as life gets. Dana, the polling numbers are still tight. They've been tight. I've still been confident for quite some time. All of a sudden, the Democrats don't seem confident. What has changed? I think they're all seeing the same things we're seeing, which is that the momentum is going in Trump's favor. And part of the reason is because Kamala Harris's media tour is having the inverse effect of what they wanted. The more people see here, the more they're thinking, wait, I don't think I can do this. The numbers are what they are. And for a long time, I believe that whoever this race ends up being about is the one that's going to lose. Because people know who Trump is. They might not like him, but they know his record. And they might think that, well, at least things were better back then. And if this is my choice, and I don't know her, but what I see of her, I'm not confident in, they won't have it. But it's not just the poll numbers. This was an astounding thing I noticed today, in all of my reading that I just did. Do you know how many Democrats are out there saying all these things she needs to do? Here's the smallest I just did this off the top of my head. They say, she needs to have another debate. That's not happening. She's doing more interviews. That's not happening. One said, she needs an energy plan. One said, she should do more town halls. I know she's got one or two, whatever. They said she needs to have an event specifically for Black men. Then she needs to have an event specifically for Latino men. And then she needs to be more interactive on the ground with the voters. And she needs to do more fundraising. And on and on. And every article I'm reading, that's all the things that she should do, that she can't do. It's like when Harold would sit here and say, Joe Biden should come out and say this, or he should do this. And he's like, Harold, that's not happening. Yeah, it's true, Harold. This is like, in your face. It's three, yeah, in your face, Harold. You're not even here. There's three weeks left with a campaign. When do they think she's going to do this? And I think all of them are doing this right now to be on record. As saying, I told you, yes. Right, Charles Blow, for example, in the New York Times today saying there's all the things she needs to do. She's not going to do those. Jay Mart also in the New York Times, Danae. Oh my gosh, there was a whole, no, no, political magazine. Same thing. No, no. No. It's so close. I read the whole thing of all the things that she should do and that's to get on record because they think she's going to lose right now. So, Judge, when the Democrats are giving advice to the top Democrat, that's when you know they're losing. Well, think about it. She made history by raising $1 billion in 80 days for a presidential candidate. That's unbelievable. And that's going to dampen the fundraising, OK? And I understand that it's so close in Pennsylvania that she's going to spend $350 million on ads in Pennsylvania. But here's the thing. We talk about, they're supposed to be that beautiful blue wall. Kamala was supposed to be the sure fire winner. But we weren't supposed to know that she couldn't speak or she couldn't respond or she couldn't do an interview. We weren't supposed to know that because Donald Trump was supposed to be in jail or worse. And that was the thinking. We were never supposed to know how inept she is at all of this, whether it's signifying or conveying a sense of empathy. Now, also, this whole idea, she took for granted. She takes for granted the blacks and the minorities as well as the blue collar worker. And with the realignment of this group with Republicans, because the Republicans are now the party of the working class, they're not trusting her. She's the one who said the border was secure. You know, she's the one who told them that there's really no inflation. And finally, this whole idea, she's trying to get men back by saying that M.H.H. and Waltz, they're really, that's true masculinity. I dare you to take a poll and put together Donald Trump and JD Vance against M.H.H. and Waltz and ask who's going to win in terms of masculinity. They even have to redefine it. Americans aren't feeling it. I don't think you want that competition. People, I mean, he has beautiful eyelashes, but JD Vance looks like he's wearing eyeliner most at the time. What do you snag? I'm terribly nervous. I know. And maybe the couch story was real. And you know what, Sethi was in, you know, carrying weapons of war. He was in background. You want to talk about it? A working class fame on his golden toilet. Let's not do this again. So you are correct. The premise of your question, Jesse, we like being scared. We run better when we're scared. This is our comfort state. And I'm thankful to be in this position versus your red wave vibe that you had before it all came crashing down. Would you rather be Donald Trump right now?

And he's like, Harold, that's not happening. Yeah, it's true, Harold. This is like, in your face. It's three, yeah, in your face, Harold. You're not even here. There's three weeks left with a campaign. When do they think she's going to do this? And I think all of them are doing this right now to be on record. As saying, I told you, yes. Right, Charles Blow, for example, in the New York Times today saying there's all the things she needs to do. She's not going to do those. Jay Mart also in the New York Times, Danae. Oh my gosh, there was a whole, no, no, political magazine. Same thing. No, no. No. It's so close. I read the whole thing of all the things that she should do and that's to get on record because they think she's going to lose right now. So, Judge, when the Democrats are giving advice to the top Democrat, that's when you know they're losing. Well, think about it. She made history by raising $1 billion in 80 days for a presidential candidate. That's unbelievable. And that's going to dampen the fundraising, OK? And I understand that it's so close in Pennsylvania that she's going to spend $350 million on ads in Pennsylvania. But here's the thing. We talk about, they're supposed to be that beautiful blue wall. Kamala was supposed to be the sure fire winner. But we weren't supposed to know that she couldn't speak or she couldn't respond or she couldn't do an interview. We weren't supposed to know that because Donald Trump was supposed to be in jail or worse. And that was the thinking. We were never supposed to know how inept she is at all of this, whether it's signifying or conveying a sense of empathy. Now, also, this whole idea, she took for granted. She takes for granted the blacks and the minorities as well as the blue collar worker. And with the realignment of this group with Republicans, because the Republicans are now the party of the working class, they're not trusting her. She's the one who said the border was secure. You know, she's the one who told them that there's really no inflation. And finally, this whole idea, she's trying to get men back by saying that M.H.H. and Waltz, they're really, that's true masculinity. I dare you to take a poll and put together Donald Trump and JD Vance against M.H.H. and Waltz and ask who's going to win in terms of masculinity. They even have to redefine it. Americans aren't feeling it. I don't think you want that competition. People, I mean, he has beautiful eyelashes, but JD Vance looks like he's wearing eyeliner most at the time. What do you snag? I'm terribly nervous. I know. And maybe the couch story was real. And you know what, Sethi was in, you know, carrying weapons of war. He was in background. You want to talk about it? A working class fame on his golden toilet. Let's not do this again. So you are correct. The premise of your question, Jesse, we like being scared. We run better when we're scared. This is our comfort state. And I'm thankful to be in this position versus your red wave vibe that you had before it all came crashing down. Would you rather be Donald Trump right now? Or would you rather be Kamala Harris? I would never rather be Trump. You know what I'm talking about. In this position, would you rather be Trump or her? The reason that I would rather be Kamala Harris is that he has to depend on low propensity voters to show up. And she has to depend on high propensity voters to show up. She has to convert people to voting for her. She has to get those moderate Republicans. But Donald Trump needs to be on the Joe Rogan circuit or the Andrew Schultz circuit to get people who don't typically show. And that's a steeper challenge. That's my honest answer. I think you like it. You're making a good face. I just can't argue with it because I don't want to. OK. Great. So I'll handle it. OK. OK. So for all of that... Great. Well, you take this one for me. Yeah. She's wearing me down. For all of the good news that there has been for Trump, and it definitely has felt like a vibe shift this week. He still only gained 0.3 points in the polls. And Nate Silver was tweeting about that today. And there were some really interesting things in the New York Times, the Anna polls. And not only was she up four points in that I'd been one of her worst polls, but now abortion is in the top three issues. And we know if abortion is in the top three issues that that favors Democrats. They also found that Kamala has support from 93% of Democrats. But Donald Trump only has support from 80% of Republicans. But there's more Republicans in Democrats. But Republicans in Democrats. OK. But actually... I didn't hear what you said, Dana. She said there are more Republicans than Democrats, and we can talk about that, but it doesn't mean they're necessarily being affiliated, it doesn't mean that you're going to vote that way. And Blueprint had a new survey out where they found that 36% of Nikki Haley's voters are going to back Harris. Only 49% of the Republican Haley voters are going to back Trump down from 64% in 2020. A lot of numbers, Jessica. A lot of numbers. Yeah, that's how elections work. A shy, a lot of votes. There might be or a loud one. And like in Wisconsin, where she appeared with Liz Cheney, the biggest group of undecided voters are moderate and Republican leaning undecided. And so you bring Liz Cheney out there. The Adam Kinzenger's of the world. Oh, God. Oh, the Arab cry. You guys... Is it going to cry if she doesn't win? If she's depending on Cheney and Kinzenger, I think there's things... What's his name? I'm sorry. Constance again. You're not sorry. Kinzenger. It's a hard name to pronounce. It's not Kinzenger. And it's Jonathan Martin, not J. Hart. That jerk, girl. Who can hear her? No one cares about him. I'm sorry. That's your favorite thing to say. I'm not sorry. It's true, though. It's true. It's Marjorie Taylor Green. Who's that? Jessica, okay. We gave you your time.

'The Five': Is the Democrats blue wall crumbling?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-3qE6hJi5g,2024-10-11 00:00:34+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win Connecticut by the largest margin?,0.6093752384185791," Democrats, being beautiful blue wall might be crumbling, Axios out with a new piece on how Kamala's electoral college firewall is slipping away. It says, quote, top democratic politicians and operatives, tell us the vital states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are getting tougher for Vice President Harris and the party's Senate candidates. Democrats also say that Kamala's media blitz was a dud. Turns out, chugging brews with Colbert and helping Howard Stern cope with his Trump derangement syndrome didn't help move the needle. And even the Democrats, hype man, James Carville is sounding worried. Listen. I want to think I feel as the elections coming November 5th. I'm scared to death, and I'll get a time to beat up. Obviously, I'm happy. You're not in a reflective mood. Not in a particular reflective mood right now. I'm very very concerned about it. What does Harris need to do with the month left? They need to be sharp, they need to be aggressive, they need to stop answering questions and start asking questions. Would you like to see or do more press conferences? I'd like for to put more things in play. All right. I want to go to Jessica first, because it seems like this is an emotional issue for you. But I'm going to go to Greg instead. Greg. I want you to just ponder. Everything you just heard, Jessica. How concerned are the Democrats really, or is this just typical Democrats freaking out? I do think that you're seeing evidence of the media slowly turning on Harris because not of her politics or her lack of policies. It's that she appears to be losing. So it's like that's a different kind of political analysis. It's not like they're equally critical of Trump and Harris. When they criticize Trump, it's because they want him to lose. When they criticize Harris, it's because she's losing. They don't want it. It's weird though. You aren't seeing Republicans becoming Democrats, but you're seeing a lot of the reverse, you know, Hispanics, Blacks, young people. And it's because they realize they've been lied to so much about bigger issues. They've been manipulated, whether it was Russian inclusion, find people, hoax, drinking bleach, hunders laptop. I think they realized that their side, and they're going to find out everybody lies. But right now, they are finding out that their side lies. Pretty soon, that's the first level of awareness. And then when you get out of there, you're going to see, wow, everybody lies about everything. And then you're going to be free. That's a true, based, red pill. But if you look at what the Democrats focus on, it's removed from real life. You know, parents concerned about trans activism. They always side with the activists. They're concerned about men identifying as women and women sports. They side with the perverted grifters. When citizens are concerned about gas and food prices, they say it doesn't exist. Remember that? They said there's no inflation. And when they're concerned about crime, they say it's going down. So if you look at the two parties, you have one that is living in some fantasy land, and another one that is almost obsessed with reality. To a fault. Republicans are obsessed, like obsessed with reality, crime, immigration, inflation. That's as real as life gets. Dana, the polling numbers are still tight. They've been tight. I've still been confident for quite some time. All of a sudden, the Democrats don't seem confident. What has changed? I think they're all seeing the same things we're seeing, which is that the momentum is going in Trump's favor. And part of the reason is because Kamala Harris's media tour is having the inverse effect of what they wanted. The more people see here, the more they're thinking, wait, I don't think I can do this. The numbers are what they are. And for a long time, I believe that whoever this race ends up being about is the one that's going to lose. Because people know who Trump is. They might not like him, but they know his record. And they might think that, well, at least things were better back then. And if this is my choice, and I don't know her, but what I see of her, I'm not confident in, they won't have it. But it's not just the poll numbers. This was an astounding thing I noticed today, in all of my reading that I just did. Do you know how many Democrats are out there saying all these things she needs to do? Here's the smallest I just did this off the top of my head. They say, she needs to have another debate. That's not happening. She's doing more interviews. That's not happening. One said, she needs an energy plan. One said, she should do more town halls. I know she's got one or two, whatever. They said she needs to have an event specifically for Black men. Then she needs to have an event specifically for Latino men. And then she needs to be more interactive on the ground with the voters. And she needs to do more fundraising. And on and on. And every article I'm reading, that's all the things that she should do, that she can't do. It's like when Harold would sit here and say, Joe Biden should come out and say this, or he should do this.

So it's like that's a different kind of political analysis. It's not like they're equally critical of Trump and Harris. When they criticize Trump, it's because they want him to lose. When they criticize Harris, it's because she's losing. They don't want it. It's weird though. You aren't seeing Republicans becoming Democrats, but you're seeing a lot of the reverse, you know, Hispanics, Blacks, young people. And it's because they realize they've been lied to so much about bigger issues. They've been manipulated, whether it was Russian inclusion, find people, hoax, drinking bleach, hunders laptop. I think they realized that their side, and they're going to find out everybody lies. But right now, they are finding out that their side lies. Pretty soon, that's the first level of awareness. And then when you get out of there, you're going to see, wow, everybody lies about everything. And then you're going to be free. That's a true, based, red pill. But if you look at what the Democrats focus on, it's removed from real life. You know, parents concerned about trans activism. They always side with the activists. They're concerned about men identifying as women and women sports. They side with the perverted grifters. When citizens are concerned about gas and food prices, they say it doesn't exist. Remember that? They said there's no inflation. And when they're concerned about crime, they say it's going down. So if you look at the two parties, you have one that is living in some fantasy land, and another one that is almost obsessed with reality. To a fault. Republicans are obsessed, like obsessed with reality, crime, immigration, inflation. That's as real as life gets. Dana, the polling numbers are still tight. They've been tight. I've still been confident for quite some time. All of a sudden, the Democrats don't seem confident. What has changed? I think they're all seeing the same things we're seeing, which is that the momentum is going in Trump's favor. And part of the reason is because Kamala Harris's media tour is having the inverse effect of what they wanted. The more people see here, the more they're thinking, wait, I don't think I can do this. The numbers are what they are. And for a long time, I believe that whoever this race ends up being about is the one that's going to lose. Because people know who Trump is. They might not like him, but they know his record. And they might think that, well, at least things were better back then. And if this is my choice, and I don't know her, but what I see of her, I'm not confident in, they won't have it. But it's not just the poll numbers. This was an astounding thing I noticed today, in all of my reading that I just did. Do you know how many Democrats are out there saying all these things she needs to do? Here's the smallest I just did this off the top of my head. They say, she needs to have another debate. That's not happening. She's doing more interviews. That's not happening. One said, she needs an energy plan. One said, she should do more town halls. I know she's got one or two, whatever. They said she needs to have an event specifically for Black men. Then she needs to have an event specifically for Latino men. And then she needs to be more interactive on the ground with the voters. And she needs to do more fundraising. And on and on. And every article I'm reading, that's all the things that she should do, that she can't do. It's like when Harold would sit here and say, Joe Biden should come out and say this, or he should do this. And he's like, Harold, that's not happening. Yeah, it's true, Harold. This is like, in your face. It's three, yeah, in your face, Harold. You're not even here. There's three weeks left with a campaign. When do they think she's going to do this? And I think all of them are doing this right now to be on record. As saying, I told you, yes. Right, Charles Blow, for example, in the New York Times today saying there's all the things she needs to do. She's not going to do those. Jay Mart also in the New York Times, Danae. Oh my gosh, there was a whole, no, no, political magazine. Same thing. No, no. No. It's so close. I read the whole thing of all the things that she should do and that's to get on record because they think she's going to lose right now. So, Judge, when the Democrats are giving advice to the top Democrat, that's when you know they're losing. Well, think about it. She made history by raising $1 billion in 80 days for a presidential candidate. That's unbelievable. And that's going to dampen the fundraising, OK? And I understand that it's so close in Pennsylvania that she's going to spend $350 million on ads in Pennsylvania. But here's the thing. We talk about, they're supposed to be that beautiful blue wall. Kamala was supposed to be the sure fire winner. But we weren't supposed to know that she couldn't speak or she couldn't respond or she couldn't do an interview. We weren't supposed to know that because Donald Trump was supposed to be in jail or worse. And that was the thinking. We were never supposed to know how inept she is at all of this, whether it's signifying or conveying a sense of empathy. Now, also, this whole idea, she took for granted. She takes for granted the blacks and the minorities as well as the blue collar worker. And with the realignment of this group with Republicans, because the Republicans are now the party of the working class, they're not trusting her. She's the one who said the border was secure. You know, she's the one who told them that there's really no inflation. And finally, this whole idea, she's trying to get men back by saying that M.H.H. and Waltz, they're really, that's true masculinity. I dare you to take a poll and put together Donald Trump and JD Vance against M.H.H. and Waltz and ask who's going to win in terms of masculinity. They even have to redefine it. Americans aren't feeling it. I don't think you want that competition. People, I mean, he has beautiful eyelashes, but JD Vance looks like he's wearing eyeliner most at the time. What do you snag? I'm terribly nervous. I know. And maybe the couch story was real. And you know what, Sethi was in, you know, carrying weapons of war. He was in background. You want to talk about it? A working class fame on his golden toilet. Let's not do this again. So you are correct. The premise of your question, Jesse, we like being scared. We run better when we're scared. This is our comfort state. And I'm thankful to be in this position versus your red wave vibe that you had before it all came crashing down. Would you rather be Donald Trump right now? Or would you rather be Kamala Harris? I would never rather be Trump. You know what I'm talking about. In this position, would you rather be Trump or her? The reason that I would rather be Kamala Harris is that he has to depend on low propensity voters to show up. And she has to depend on high propensity voters to show up. She has to convert people to voting for her. She has to get those moderate Republicans. But Donald Trump needs to be on the Joe Rogan circuit or the Andrew Schultz circuit to get people who don't typically show. And that's a steeper challenge. That's my honest answer. I think you like it. You're making a good face. I just can't argue with it because I don't want to. OK. Great. So I'll handle it. OK. OK. So for all of that... Great. Well, you take this one for me. Yeah. She's wearing me down. For all of the good news that there has been for Trump, and it definitely has felt like a vibe shift this week. He still only gained 0.3 points in the polls. And Nate Silver was tweeting about that today. And there were some really interesting things in the New York Times, the Anna polls. And not only was she up four points in that I'd been one of her worst polls, but now abortion is in the top three issues. And we know if abortion is in the top three issues that that favors Democrats. They also found that Kamala has support from 93% of Democrats. But Donald Trump only has support from 80% of Republicans. But there's more Republicans in Democrats. But Republicans in Democrats. OK. But actually... I didn't hear what you said, Dana. She said there are more Republicans than Democrats, and we can talk about that, but it doesn't mean they're necessarily being affiliated, it doesn't mean that you're going to vote that way. And Blueprint had a new survey out where they found that 36% of Nikki Haley's voters are going to back Harris. Only 49% of the Republican Haley voters are going to back Trump down from 64% in 2020. A lot of numbers, Jessica. A lot of numbers. Yeah, that's how elections work. A shy, a lot of votes. There might be or a loud one. And like in Wisconsin, where she appeared with Liz Cheney, the biggest group of undecided voters are moderate and Republican leaning undecided. And so you bring Liz Cheney out there. The Adam Kinzenger's of the world. Oh, God. Oh, the Arab cry. You guys... Is it going to cry if she doesn't win? If she's depending on Cheney and Kinzenger, I think there's things... What's his name? I'm sorry. Constance again. You're not sorry. Kinzenger. It's a hard name to pronounce. It's not Kinzenger. And it's Jonathan Martin, not J. Hart. That jerk, girl. Who can hear her? No one cares about him. I'm sorry. That's your favorite thing to say. I'm not sorry. It's true, though. It's true. It's Marjorie Taylor Green. Who's that? Jessica, okay. We gave you your time.

'The Five': Is the Democrats blue wall crumbling?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-3qE6hJi5g,2024-10-11 00:00:34+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win Massachusetts by the largest margin?,0.6009944081306458," Democrats, being beautiful blue wall might be crumbling, Axios out with a new piece on how Kamala's electoral college firewall is slipping away. It says, quote, top democratic politicians and operatives, tell us the vital states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are getting tougher for Vice President Harris and the party's Senate candidates. Democrats also say that Kamala's media blitz was a dud. Turns out, chugging brews with Colbert and helping Howard Stern cope with his Trump derangement syndrome didn't help move the needle. And even the Democrats, hype man, James Carville is sounding worried. Listen. I want to think I feel as the elections coming November 5th. I'm scared to death, and I'll get a time to beat up. Obviously, I'm happy. You're not in a reflective mood. Not in a particular reflective mood right now. I'm very very concerned about it. What does Harris need to do with the month left? They need to be sharp, they need to be aggressive, they need to stop answering questions and start asking questions. Would you like to see or do more press conferences? I'd like for to put more things in play. All right. I want to go to Jessica first, because it seems like this is an emotional issue for you. But I'm going to go to Greg instead. Greg.

Harris cracks a beer with Stephen Colbert as millions flee Hurricane Milton,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDVS6mGxxQo,2024-10-09 12:15:02+00:00,Will Caitlin Clark endorse Kamala Harris?,0.646216869354248," This morning is millions of hurricane Milton in Florida. Vice President Kamala Harris wrapping up a softball media blitz here in New York City. Littlely cracking jokes and cracking a beer with Steven Colbert. Would you like to have a beer with me so I can tell people what that's like? Okay. This was, now we asked ahead of time because I can't just be giving a drink to the Vice President of the United States. But I asked you, you asked for Miller Highlight. You were on Highlight. I'm just curious. Okay. The last time my beer was at a baseball game with Doug. Okay. Cheers. There you go. That crowd, we're ours. But is that the right move here to react former senior advisor to Tim Scott, his presidential campaign, Matt Gorman, Matt, your reaction, your communications guy. If that's your client, is that the move? I mean, she wants to have her cake and eat it too. She wants to go yuck it up with the view and Steven Colbert, we're all openly supportive. And yet she also wants to insert herself with Ron DeSantis and try and play president. And when she never has done this before and then criticize him when he won't go along with it, you can't do both. You go and do these softball interviews or go pretend you're president at the White House of Joe Biden. I mean, you have President Biden canceled his trip, no angle and no Germany. And he's got to stick around. And he's praising governors for stepping up for a second major hurricane. And she's going from how it's turned to the view to Steven Colbert show after doing 60 minutes. Remember, she wants people to have empathy and care about the American people. Tell me if this show, remember these accusations and then keep in mind what she just did having a beer. Watch. What just upsets me so is the idea that any politician would play political games with these folks, with people who are in the midst of such suffering, loss of life, loss of their homes, loss of normalcy. And then for the sake of political gain, tell these lies in a way that is meant to make people distrust, the help that is there for them to receive. And it's crude. Have you know empathy man? If you watch what happened in western part, in the western part of North Carolina, if you saw the special operations and all the groups that had to go in because FEMA wasn't there, if you saw the civilian choppers and taking 10 days to call the army in, you don't think you're open to criticism for that. And how does Steven Colbert even, he's always a comedian, not know that. I mean, yeah, you want to talk about empathy too. Where was she when this was barreling down on those folks in North Carolina in George's and the West Coast with celebrities raising money? And Joe Biden was in Rohobeth, didn't go back to the White House. And again, she's up in New York. And again, what is all, talk about empathy, what about the empathy for a governor who's staring down a cat five in the face, trapped, protect his residents and his state, and then going out and calling himselfish because he won't indulge your little campaign stunt. It's ridiculous. And Matt, you just, you didn't tell our producers, you see a huge problem between Biden, passive aggressive against the vice president. And when he praised his Santa C.S.J. the Oval Office, that was more evidence of it. Colin, a press conference in the middle of her event. That was more evidence of it. And the fact that she says she was there with me every step of the way, is that more evidence? Oh, absolutely. You've seen this over the last week or so. You're right. Going out right when she's about to start her event, then just really giving her a big bare hug, that unpopular president saying she's a major player and everything I've done. And then also, yeah, you're right. Yesterday, he just threw out of the bus and debunked what she was saying, going over the top, saying how communicative and cooperative DeSantis was. And we're all working together. He's doing a good job. When he did not have to do that, I can imagine the White House was getting a pretty angry call from the Harris campaign when they heard that. Yeah, I hope they work it out. You know, I'm going to say I'm just, I hope everybody gets along. Thanks, Matt. I'm Steve Doosie. I'm Brian Killme.

Bush endorse Kamala Harris?,0.6384367346763611," This morning is millions of hurricane Milton in Florida. Vice President Kamala Harris wrapping up a softball media blitz here in New York City. Littlely cracking jokes and cracking a beer with Steven Colbert. Would you like to have a beer with me so I can tell people what that's like? Okay. This was, now we asked ahead of time because I can't just be giving a drink to the Vice President of the United States. But I asked you, you asked for Miller Highlight. You were on Highlight. I'm just curious. Okay. The last time my beer was at a baseball game with Doug. Okay. Cheers. There you go. That crowd, we're ours. But is that the right move here to react former senior advisor to Tim Scott, his presidential campaign, Matt Gorman, Matt, your reaction, your communications guy. If that's your client, is that the move? I mean, she wants to have her cake and eat it too. She wants to go yuck it up with the view and Steven Colbert, we're all openly supportive. And yet she also wants to insert herself with Ron DeSantis and try and play president. And when she never has done this before and then criticize him when he won't go along with it, you can't do both. You go and do these softball interviews or go pretend you're president at the White House of Joe Biden. I mean, you have President Biden canceled his trip, no angle and no Germany. And he's got to stick around. And he's praising governors for stepping up for a second major hurricane. And she's going from how it's turned to the view to Steven Colbert show after doing 60 minutes. Remember, she wants people to have empathy and care about the American people. Tell me if this show, remember these accusations and then keep in mind what she just did having a beer. Watch.

Kamala Harris goes viral for stunning admission on 'The View',https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VxoF-s8fDU,2024-10-09 10:45:00+00:00,Will any other Democratic Politician win the 2024 US Presidential Election?,0.6199299693107605," As Florida braces for its second major hurricane in less than two weeks, Vice President Kamala Harris is living it up on her New York City media tour. If he wins, God forbid. Would you feel safe in this country? Would you stay in this country? Howard, I'm doing everything I can to make sure he does not win. Let's Kamala, and I'm calling you Kamala because for all of those who are mispronouncing it, I want you all to know how to say it. I like candidates who show up for interviews. Just saying. Would you like to have a beer with me so I can tell people what that's like? My beer was at a baseball game with Doug, so I'm here to share. Joe Conte is a Fox News contributor. He joins us now, big picture, Joe. How did Kamala come off doing what I'm going to call comfortable interviews at a time when millions of people are mere hours away from being anything but comfortable, having their entire lives upended in an instant? The optics are profoundly horrific, Todd. I mean, she comes across as an elitist doing a tour around New York City with her friends. And let's not call this a media blitz because these are not media people that she spoke to for the most part when we're talking about cold beer, when we're talking about the view when we're talking about Howard Stern. And this is the quandary now, guys, for Kamala and her campaign. If you keep her in the so-called basement, then voters don't get to know her and the fear of the unknown becomes real. But if you put her out there, even in the friendliest of environments, she can't handle even the easiest of softballs for the most part. And after two days of Kamala Harris being the focus for once and Donald Trump not being the focus for once for the most part, this so-called media blitz was a net negative. Because the only clips that are making the rounds after the fact on social media to the tunes of millions of views show once again that Kamala Harris is all bubbles and no bath when it comes to substance. So I think that the plan was, okay, let's put her in friendly environments and people will get to know her. But those environments like cold beer, the view, Howard, those are all people that are going to vote for Kamala Harris anyway. So I don't know what she gains at this point from doing those interviews. Now 60 minutes was a different story, however. Yeah, that was a hard hitting one and I was just looking up and you kind of have to laugh because all of this is so staged and scripted Joe and we show the clip of Kamala drink in the beer. And Stephen Colbert even said during the interview that he had to ask her and her team beforehand if she wanted to do that. And she requested Miller High Life Why? Well, it's from Wisconsin, which is a swing state. It's all about politics. And earlier that morning, she was on the view and this is one of the moments that's really going viral on social media is one of the first questions that she was asked her the question and how she answered it. Okay. If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years? There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of and I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact. The work that we have done. So not a thing that comes to mind, Joe, on the same day that we find out that there's an Afghan national that who came in on a special immigrant visa, those planning a terrorist attack on election day. And also one of the other things about that is her whole campaign platform is that she's going to be a change candidate and she's a fresh face. But there she is saying that nothing comes to mind on if she would do anything different over the last four years. Boy, Carly, it would be quite the irony. If we look back in this campaign, if Kamala Harris loses, that the moment the campaign truly went south, happened on all places, the view. I mean, let's underscore this, no Democrat candidate or politician has ever screwed up an interview on that program because the compounds are that friendly to any member of that party. And somehow the vice president still screwed it up in the most crap, plastic fashion, one could imagine. That T-Ball question, would you do anything differently from the past four years? There's a dozen ways to answer that question safely. But Kamala Harris is internal CPU that is her brain was not programmed to take this question. So the only thing she could spit out is that she wouldn't change anything for the last four years. Just 28% of voters in this country say the country is on the right track under Biden Harris. That's according to GALP. That ain't good, especially when it comes to inflation, wages, crime, border, foreign policy. And her argument is that everything has gone according to plan. And I would do the same thing all over again if given the opportunity. That's a campaign ad for Trump. And that's three minutes later, guys, and I'll leave it here. Somebody else got in her ear because they said you better revisit that answer. So she repeated the question back that she got 40 minutes beforehand and said that, yeah, the difference between Joe Biden and me is that I would add a Republican to my candidate, which I guess means say hello to Secretary of Defense Liz Cheney and your White House press secretary Nicole Wallace. So that's what what happened yesterday. And I'll leave it here actually. Kudos to Bill Whitaker over 60 minutes because for the first time, Kamala Harris actually took something called a tough question or two or three. And he also has follow up questions. I never saw someone blink as much as Kamala Harris did during that interview, but that definitely did not go well. So the question is, do they put her back out there or do they bring her back in? There is no good option. It seems that this point for her or for Tim Walls for that matter. Not on 60 minutes. I can tell you that much. New York Times yesterday says voters are increasingly viewing Kamala as the change candidate to your point, Joe. If I'm Donald Trump, I just air that unedited clip to reverse that in response because I think that totally undermines what the New York Times is saying there. She ain't the change candidate if she just literally on the easiest platform possible says, Joe and I did everything together. That don't look good. Joe, always looks good. Joe Concha, we appreciate it. Thank you, sir. I'm Steve Doosie. I'm Brian Killme.

Gutfeld: CBS News tried to salvage this train wreck,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jgfFP9BRxE,2024-10-09 03:15:02+00:00,Kamala Harris blowout victory?,0.6028313636779785," Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I get it. Yes. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. You love me. What can you do? That'd be Tuesday, everyone. So, Kamala Harris is in the middle of a media blitz. She's done the view. 60 minutes Stephen Colbert Howard Stern. She's been in front of more old Farts than Bryant's Delta's Boxers. Last night, she made a disastrous, painful appearance on 60 minutes. It was so bad Joe Biden turned over and his grave. And after that train wreck, Harris appeared on the view where she said she wouldn't have done anything differently than Joe Biden during the last four years. Well, except pick a better vice president. A fun side note, when the Secret Service patted down Joy Behar, they found a foot long bratwurst and 14 pounds of killbassa. But we'd be remiss if we didn't wish Joy a happy birthday. She turned 82 yesterday. To celebrate, she hit a pinata full of sardines. Her cake didn't have any candles in case would be Goldberg's wind. Meanwhile, Tim Waltz visited Jimmy Kimmel's show last night. He revealed he saved Kammel's number as my dry cleaner. Hmm. The White House can always use one of those, said one man. LAUGHTER You know, never gets old. But it makes you wonder what alias does Kammel have for Waltz in her phone? LAUGHTER The White House has promoted press secretary, Karee Jean-Pierre, to senior advisor to the president, which means for the next eight weeks, she'll help president, the president, make the transition from the Oval Office to his new home. LAUGHTER By the way, what the hell was she wearing yesterday? Do you see that? Obviously, that's a jacket from the Charles Payne collection. LAUGHTER According to the Wall Street Journal, pajama pants are now acceptable in the workplace, prompting one executive to say, pants? LAUGHTER In a recent interview, Hillary Clinton suggested prison for those who post misinformation. And once in prison, the cameras should be unplugged and the guards should be extremely drowsy. LAUGHTER Finally, scientists have been able to engineer a bacteria that actually eats plastic. Upon hearing the news, Nancy Pelosi went into hiding. LAUGHTER All right. Now, when all this fails... LAUGHTER So Kammel Harris went on 60 minutes last night and made sense for exactly zero. She spoke with Bill Whitaker. And she said, it's his credit, he asked some tough questions. But that's like giving a mailman credit for not stealing packages. True Kammel had got grilled like a house cat in Springfield, Ohio. LAUGHTER A lot of hard questions. Of course, any question is hard for Kammel. Her IQ is room temperature at best. If that room is a walk-in freezer. But 60 minutes was happy to help her out. Listen to this preview clip they released before the full interview aired on the subject of Israel. It seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. LAUGHTER What the f*** was that? LAUGHTER Now... LAUGHTER She's the only presidential candidate in history who needs a translator even when speaking English. But get this, after Kammel got dragged online for that, it seems CBS helped her clean it up. Listen to what aired last night following that same question. It seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. We're not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end. Same question. Two different answers. The White House hasn't seen a cleanup like that since they had a blast-steam byden seat cushions. It's kind of a big deal. But maybe she knows more about the economy. There are lots of signs that the American economy is doing very well. Better than most countries, I think. But the American people don't seem to be feeling it. Groceries. They're 25% higher. And people are blaming you and Joe Biden for that. Are they wrong? We now have historic low unemployment in America among all groups of people. We now have an economy that is thriving by all macroeconomic measures. By all macroeconomic measures, like, say, inflation, the thing that he asked about, Harris wouldn't know a macroeconomic measure if it slapped her in the face. Don't get any ideas, Doug. But her price is still too high, and does she know that? And, to your point, prices are still too high. And I know that, and we need to deal with it, which is why part of my plan. You mentioned groceries. Part of my plan is what we must do to bring down the price of groceries. I'm taking it. Harris says she'll press Congress to pass a federal ban on price-gouging for food and groceries. But details are yet to be defined. Wow, her voice changed. Did you hear that, too? Apparently, her answer was so bad. CBS made their own correspondent answer it in a voiceover. Now, our economic plan would add $3 trillion to the federal debt. I hope she asks her how she's going to pay for that. How are you going to pay for that? Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it. But my plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Pardon me, not a vice president. The question was, how are you going to pay for it? Well, one of the things I'm going to make sure that the richest among us who can afford it pay their fair share in taxes. But we're dealing with the real world here. But the real world includes how are you going to get this to Congress? You know, when you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about because they're constituents, no exactly what I'm talking about. So eggs cost twice as much as they did four years ago because the rich aren't paying enough taxes. Those two things have about as much to do with each other as Brian Kilmeet and fan mail. Wow. So what about her switching up positions like Optimus Prime doing yoga? What you got to say about that? They say the reason so many voters don't know you is that you have changed your position on so many things. So many that people don't truly know what you believe or what you stand for. And I know you've heard that. In the last four years, I have been vice president of the United States and I have been traveling our country. And I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. We are a diverse people. Geographically, regionally in terms of where we are in our backgrounds. And what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus. You change your position on fracking, defending the cops and the border because you traveled? Well, I'm going to Thailand next month. Maybe then I'll support men playing women's sports. When she says building consensus, she really means lying. So how about her specialty, the border? There was an historic flood of undocumented immigrants coming across the border the first three years of your administration. As a matter of fact, arrivals quadrupled from the last year of president Trump. Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did? It's a long standing problem. And solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions. What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place? The policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem. But numbers did quadrupled. And the numbers today, Bishop. Quadrupled, great. Now you've taught her a new word. It's going to be saying it all month. Well, CBS did what they could to salvage this train wreck. The whole thing was chopped up like a line of coke on the ass of one of Hunter's escorts. Still, she didn't make any sense. But doesn't matter, this entire media blitz with a month left isn't meant to convince anyone. Harris is irrelevant. She could be anybody. She is anybody. The apparatus behind her, however, is hoping you follow this media trick or treating and not pay attention to what's going on behind the scenes. Remember the Time Magazine piece on the Shadow campaign that got Biden into the White House? The Alliance of Left Wing activists, government and media who forced changes in voting systems and laws, secured hundreds of millions in funding, recruited armies of poll workers, and pressed social media companies to suppress stories like Hunter's laptop. That's nothing compared to now. Governor Newsom just banned voter ID. Why? If not for fraud? Couple of that with its massive growth in numbers of migrants in swing states since 2021. And you see that something's up and it's far worse than the Democrats' awful candidate. I mean, she sucks. But that's a deflection from the setup right in front of us. You got to ask, why in God's name would they run something that bad if it mattered? They wouldn't, so it doesn't. What matters is that you see what's really going on and it's another deep state shell game. And they win if you pick the candidate with an empty skull. Let's welcome Gary Stokes. There's nothing funny about his failed marriage or his act after writer comedian Jamie Lissard. He could have a series on his wild theories, hosted the Gryfft report, Ho-Tep Jesus. She's our court jester in her second trimester. New York Times has held a gathering about this. Get in the way, get in the way. And with his stomach growls, female lions get horny. New York Times best held a golden ring in front of you. Let's call it a court. That's probably true. Jamie is Kamala's visit to 60 minutes, a bigger dumpster fire than your marriage. Yes, yes. Watching it though, it seemed longer. Yes. I know, we did too many clips. No, the interview though. You guys did good. So that editing was absolutely brutal. I mean, it was, it was, it's horrible. It's disgusting. But it was absolutely brilliant. They ran the whole hour interview. They ran it through a f*** filter. Yeah. And then it was only seven minutes long. Yes. After they got it. This is, it's, the numbers are right there though, man. Like grocery groceries are like 30% higher. Gas is 40% higher. And it says here, Kamala is 30% higher than she was. She definitely is enjoying stuff. She's enjoying time when she shouldn't. That's always a sign when you're on something like, you're having a good time. But everybody's like, this holy f***ing what she talking about. Ho-tap, would you make of this? Greg, I was raised in the middle class house cold. Oh, you did. You know, I thought it was bad. We had a brain dead president. Yeah. We got a brain dead vice president, too. We are doomed. But if I was, if I was her, I would fire my team. ASAP. Because they should have never let her do any interview without a teleprompter. Yeah. At all. Because she's not fit for it. She doesn't have a brain. She's not natural. She doesn't ought to be real. And she missed her moment. If you look at, I believe it was a DNC. The DNC when she comes out on stage. And everybody's clapping for her. Big ovation. And she's like, all right, everybody calm down. And she's like, you're acting like a bitchy mom. Like that's not what you're supposed to do. It wasn't presidential. It showed that she wasn't ready for the moment. She's not ready to be president. All she had to do was come out and just, you know, thank you and calm the crowd down. Or just speak. Just start speaking in the crowd. It just shows she's not prepared. I'm terrified if she actually gets elected. You should be. Pat, once again, we must ask the question, what has she been up to for four years, which she's getting worse? I resent the fact that I'm expected to answer that question a way that makes sense. I have to make sure all my words go together and everything. Yes. And apparently she can just say whatever. And then they'll like, paste something else in there. Yes. Is that incredible? Arguably the job that she wants is more influential than the one that I have. Yeah. It's remarkable. It really is. I don't know what she's been doing the last four years. Either she's had nothing to do with all of this or everything to do with all of this, depending on what she says. Because you can't take her word for it because her word kind of changes all the time and is all over the place. This was truly remarkable to watch. And again, I don't know why there aren't more follow-up questions. Well, that's a good point, but also, Tyrus, how did CBS think that nobody was going to notice that they released a segment and then they took it out? Because it was hard to listen to her answer the first time. Yes. Maybe they just assumed they could sneak it by or maybe they just figured they'll take it. Thank you for the question. Yes. We have a consensus of the message that we were trying to get out. And that message is the consensus that is... Yeah. Okay, if anything, if you take all the stereotypes about us, one thing we do have is a rhythm. Okay, and we don't forget that's the photograph of memory in a beat of the drum. The rhythm is not there, and she can't even remember her own f***. But when they asked her about the gun, and she... Yeah, I got a glock. What kind? Yes. And her answer was And Om. Yeah. And Om. Those were invented by nervous white people around Black people. And Om. And Om. And Om. And Om. And Om. And Om. And Om. We've done. All right. Up next is The New York Times Insane for Trashing Trump's Brain. Yeah! You're the best at the time. You're the best at the time. You're the best at the time. You're the best at the time. You're the best at the time. You're the best at the time. You're the best at the time. You're the best at the time. You're the best at the time. You're the best at the time.

You're the best at the time. You're the best at the time. You're the best at the time. You're the best at the time. You're the best at the time. You're the best at the time."
Jesse Watters: Kamala Harris couldnt even survive The View,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yDh8jV4yPE,2024-10-09 02:00:03+00:00,Kamala Harris blowout victory?,0.6245355606079102," Uh-oh, Barack's not happy. After hiding Harris all fall, Democrats watched her numbers drop. It was time to change strategy. Obama ordered Kamala. You're doing immediate blints. But Harris couldn't handle the pressure. She couldn't even survive the view. If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years? There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of... And I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact. This was the one excuse she had for not solving problems for four years. Hey, you know, I was only VP. I don't call the shots. This was her one saving grace that let people think, maybe she's not Joe Biden. Maybe she can be different. Maybe she can bring change. And she just went on the view and said, I'm Joe Biden. I wouldn't have done anything differently the last four years. At the debate, she declared, I'm not Joe Biden. And today she says she is. She even flipped on whether she's Joe Biden. Afghanistan wouldn't have done anything differently. Inflation the border. If she had to go back and do it over, she would have done everything the same. If she had a time machine, she'd hurt the country all over again. She has no regrets. She must really hate you. Joe Biden was so unpopular. He got whacked by Democrats and she learned nothing from that. She just went on live TV and said, yeah, Biden, that's my guy. I'm a Biden Democrat. Now we know how Kamala climbed her way to the top. Blind loyalty. And now that she's all alone at the top, she doesn't know what to do with herself. She's still kissing up to the guy she could. This whole election is about change. And she just went on TV and said, oh, more of the same. She handed Trump the one campaign ad that Democrats were dreading. CNN can't believe it. I'm surprised, frankly, that she doesn't have more to say about this, given that she and her campaign know that this is one of the main questions that voters have about her. And one of the main things she's been trying to establish as part of her candidacy is the idea that she would represent a break from the past four years and to not be able to come up with something to say in that moment. She continues to not be particularly nimble on her feet in a lot of these interviews. Who would have thought the view would trip up to Harris campaign? They were giving her an opportunity to say, I'm proud to serve with Joe Biden and I'm proud of X, Y and Z, what we did. But I would have told the Fed to wake up and raise rates much earlier, a crush inflation. And the next four years, I'll show you what I'm made of. How am I better at being Harris than Harris? She's been doing this her whole life. She's not very good at it. And if you think she was unprepared for the view, watch her on 60 minutes. The first bill we proposed to Congress was to fix our broken immigration system, knowing that if you want to actually fix it, we need Congress to act. It was not taken up. The rivals quadrupled from the last year of President Trump. Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did? It's a long-standing problem. And solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions. But what I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place? I think the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem. OK. But the numbers did quadruple. She can't even answer the question, because she never tried to fix the border until it was an election year. She claimed she sent an immigration bill to Congress on day one, and it wasn't taken up. Well, prime time producers investigated, because from all we remembered, added a gate Biden signed seven executive orders shredding Trump's border policies. We didn't recall a Biden-Harris immigration bill on a inauguration day, because Biden-Harris didn't propose a bill fixing the immigration system. We discovered they submitted an amnesty bill that would give citizenship to all of the illegals in the country. And part of that bill, you can't call them illegals. You have to call them undocumented. Nancy and Chuck controlled the house in the Senate back then. No wonder they didn't take it up. It was political suicide. The bill was just a ruse, just like the border bill this year. Kamala said, Bidenomics was working, and the border was secure for four years. Now she's saying she has a bunch of solutions to the problems. She said weren't problems. It's a long-standing problem. And solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions. Because solutions are at hand. And solutions are at hand. So the solution to the border is to blame Trump. What's the solution to high prices? Groceries are 25% higher. And people are blaming you and Joe Biden for that. Are they wrong? To your point, prices are still too high. And I know that. And we need to deal with it, which is why part of my plan. You mentioned groceries. Part of my plan is what we must do to bring down the price of groceries. Kamala Harris then never shares her plan to bring down grocery prices. Bill Whitaker at CBS is forced to tell the audience this. Listen. Harris says she'll press Congress to pass a federal ban on price-couging for food and groceries. But details are yet to be defined. What is Bill Whitaker, her interpreter? Inflation is the number one issue in the country. She's on 60 minutes a month before the election. And the press has to explain what Harris's plan is, because she didn't. And CBS is forced to say, like, here's her plan, but there's no details. What am I watching? What promise has Kamala ever kept? She said she'd wire rural America with broadband, never did it. She said she'd build car chargers, never did it. She said she'd secure the border, never did it, bring down prices, never did it. Why are we hiring a woman who's never kept a single promise? At one point in the interview, 60 minutes was like, who are you? The reason so many voters don't know you is that you have changed your position on so many things. You were against fracking, now you're for it. You supported Lucer immigration policies. Now you're tightening them up. You were for Medicare for all. Now you're not. So many that people don't truly know what you believe or what you stand for. And I know you've heard that. In the last four years, I have been vice-president in the United States. And I have been traveling our country. And I have been listening to folks. And seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. Kamala hasn't been seeking common ground. She's been seeking common sense. All of these positions she's just adopted are common sense conservative positions. She didn't build consensus. She's just agreeing with the rest of the country now to get elected. 60 minutes was like, you realize you didn't earn this, right? Was democracy best served by president Biden stepping down and basically handing you a nomination? You didn't have to go through a primary process. You didn't have to fight off other contenders. That's not really the way our system was intended to work. I am proud to have received the endorsement of leaders around this country from every background and walk of life to fight in this election over the next month for our democracy. But I think this truncated process is why people think or say they don't really know who you are. Look, I've been in this race for 70 days. Kamala struggled to justify why she's running for president and even why she's the nominee. And if you wanted the country to get to know you, why have you been hiding? Everybody that's gotten to know Kamala quit. 72% of her staff work for her, found out who she was, and just walked off the job. All she does ever is talk about Trump. The country's bored by that. They want to hear from politicians, how are you going to help the country? When you hear, you know, the vanses and the Trumps talking about what's happening here at home and saying things like America first and making America great again, that messaging sometimes resonates a lot more. Absolutely. That sometimes the government made a lot more. Democrats see the numbers. Internal polling has Kamala losing Michigan. And now in Wisconsin, Democrats say Harris is down three. This is what gamblers do when they're down. Double their bets to get out of the hole. That's what Obama's polling here. Kamala's down. So let's double her media and see if we get lucky. If the bet works, Obama's a genius and he can relax with his martini in Hawaii. If it doesn't work, Biden's going to say, see, Barry, I told you so. Why do you think I didn't letter out of the White House? So Barry's about to get humiliated. His only option is to save the Senate. So the Messiah is cutting ads for politicians we've never heard of. Building a better future starts by electing people who know you, who see you, and who understand what you're going through. That's why it's so important to reelect Jackie Rosen. Jackie Ho? The whole reason Barack bounced Joe was because he was going to lose the White House and the Senate. If Kamala was the answer, why did they all of a sudden need Barack to save the Senate? That doesn't matter. Barack will just blame Nancy. Click here to subscribe to the Fox News YouTube page to catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. You won't get it anywhere else."
Laura Ingraham: Democrats are trapped,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VI8DXS_AFIA,2024-10-09 01:12:27+00:00,Kamala Harris blowout victory?,0.7158851623535156," Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Ingram. This is the Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. The unserious woman. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Democrats are in a box. They're trapped inside and it's a box of their own making. Slowly but surely, Kamala Harris is being exposed for what she is. An empty pantsuit. Even when obvious questions are asked, she won't answer them. You have changed your position on so many things. You were against fracking. Now you're for it. You supported Lucer immigration policies. Now you're tightening them up. You were for Medicare for all. Now you're not. So many that people don't truly know what you believe or what you stand for. And I know you've heard that. In the last four years, I have been Vice President of the United States and I have been traveling our country. And I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. We are a diverse people. Geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds. And what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus. Where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing. As long as you don't compromise your values. To find common sense solutions. And that has been my approach. How does that explain the flip-flopping again? Well, after this interview, Americans will understand why that the campaign had to keep her so sheltered. But that strategy allowed Donald Trump to run the table. And since the debate, he's been on the move almost without a break. He's the energizer, Bunny candidate, which is making the media and Democrats very, very anxious. She's got such a big problem with men. I mean, there's an under account of the Trump vote. I think there is misadjacent misadjacent in all of this. Black and white men. Big problem, but also the business world. They don't think she is serious. They don't think she's a heavyweight. Because she's not a heavyweight. Now, think about it. Since the coup against Biden, they've tried to promote her as the true change candidate. I think people are exhausted. And they're ready to turn the page and chart a new way forward. I believe in my soul and heart. The American people are ready to turn the page. I think we all know it's time to turn the page. It's time to turn the page. Well, folks, it's time to turn the page. But today, on the view, Kamala blew up her own narrative. Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years? There is done a thing that comes to mind. Nothing that comes to mind. So much for being the change candidate. How does she not have a prepared answer for that question, by the way? Kamala Harris just wrote a devastating campaign commercial for the Trump campaign. Inflation, Afghanistan, the border, all the disaster under Biden. And she can't think of anything she should do differently. Has the woman not seen the right track, wrong track surveys that are out there? Yeah, not good. If you like the direction that we're going in as a country, high gas prices, high grocery bills, the high cost of insurance, going to take away your car, the gas-powered car, or healthcare costs, Kamala is definitely your gal. She's just another puppet of the failed establishment. She's Biden without the experience. A serious candidate doesn't avoid doing a real press conference and then sit down with a sex and dating podcaster. Can you tell the daddy gang when people tell you know, when people look at you and doubt you? What is that ignite in you? I don't hear no. I don't hear no. And I urge all the daddy gang, don't hear no. A serious candidate doesn't choose to attack a popular governor who's been nothing but masterful in leading a state through crises and natural disasters. Here's Kamala off the cuff. NBC has reporting governor's a fantasy ignoring your calls on hurricanes, resources, and health. How does that hurt the situation here? It's just utterly irresponsible and it is selfish and it is about political gamesmanship. Is that it's doing the job that you just know to do, which is to put the people first. Now, to call her response, dim wooded is an insult to dim wood everywhere. She's not even smart enough to know not to pick a fight with someone who's both really smart and whose state is about to get hit by the worst curve hurricane and what, a century? We've been on an emergency footing for two weeks straight, round the clock 24, 7. She has never called on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president until apparently now, while the sudden is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown any interest in the past. We know it's because of politics. We know it's because of her campaign. I have zero time to entertain these political games. Again, Kamala's hurricane smear. It's just another fumble, a fumble by a player who never should have been put on the field in the first place. She's so bad that she makes Biden seem presidential and suddenly engaged, engaged enough to let her twist in the wind. The government of Florida has been cooperative. He said he's gotten all that he needs. I talked to him again yesterday and I said, I said, no, you're doing a great job. It's been all being done well. Thank you for it. And I literally gave my personal phone number to call. Maybe Joe Biden is the one turning the page. Because even in his diminished state, he probably knows how unserious Kamala is. A serious candidate knows how to answer predictable questions. Was democracy best served by President Biden stepping down and basically handing you a nomination? You didn't have to go through a primary process. You didn't have to fight off other contenders. That's not really the way our system was intended to work. President Biden made a decision that I think history is going to show is rare among leaders. Which was to put country before self. And I am proud to have earned the support of the vast majority of delegates and to have been elected the Democratic nominee. But I think this truncated process is why people think or say they don't really know who you are. Look, I've been in this race for 70 days. It is my responsibility to earn the vote. And I'm going to work to do that. But increasingly, it looks like she's going to be relying on celebrity surrogates to do the heavy lifting for her. I would really like it if the discourse could become kinder and more effective. And I think that that will be the case with Kamala Harris and Tim Walton. Hi, I'm Bruce Brankstein. I'm supporting Kamala Harris for president and Tim Walts for vice president and opposing Donald Trump and JD Vance. Glory to the past, you're back. And you know, Democrats are desperately hoping that Taylor Swift and Obama somehow carry them to victory as well. I've even heard they're going to beg George W. Bush to endorse Kamala Harris. Well, here's the cold hard truth. Harris is simply not capable of performing the type of functions that we as Americans associate with being the president of the United States. She doesn't understand the issues at the level of detail necessary to make effective decisions. She doesn't have the type of political support necessary to bend official Washington to her will. She doesn't have the type of judgment needed to read the moods of foreign leaders. None of that. Now, the Democrats already tried having a figurehead president with Biden and it ended so badly that they fired him a few months ago. And yet now they're doing the same thing. Only she's even less serious at a time when we face countless serious challenges. And for us, that would spell serious trouble. And that's the angle."

I'm Laura Ingram. This is the Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. The unserious woman. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Democrats are in a box. They're trapped inside and it's a box of their own making. Slowly but surely, Kamala Harris is being exposed for what she is. An empty pantsuit. Even when obvious questions are asked, she won't answer them. You have changed your position on so many things. You were against fracking. Now you're for it. You supported Lucer immigration policies. Now you're tightening them up. You were for Medicare for all. Now you're not. So many that people don't truly know what you believe or what you stand for. And I know you've heard that. In the last four years, I have been Vice President of the United States and I have been traveling our country. And I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. We are a diverse people. Geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds. And what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus. Where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing. As long as you don't compromise your values. To find common sense solutions. And that has been my approach. How does that explain the flip-flopping again? Well, after this interview, Americans will understand why that the campaign had to keep her so sheltered. But that strategy allowed Donald Trump to run the table. And since the debate, he's been on the move almost without a break. He's the energizer, Bunny candidate, which is making the media and Democrats very, very anxious. She's got such a big problem with men. I mean, there's an under account of the Trump vote. I think there is misadjacent misadjacent in all of this. Black and white men. Big problem, but also the business world. They don't think she is serious. They don't think she's a heavyweight. Because she's not a heavyweight. Now, think about it. Since the coup against Biden, they've tried to promote her as the true change candidate. I think people are exhausted. And they're ready to turn the page and chart a new way forward. I believe in my soul and heart. The American people are ready to turn the page. I think we all know it's time to turn the page. It's time to turn the page. Well, folks, it's time to turn the page. But today, on the view, Kamala blew up her own narrative. Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years? There is done a thing that comes to mind. Nothing that comes to mind. So much for being the change candidate. How does she not have a prepared answer for that question, by the way? Kamala Harris just wrote a devastating campaign commercial for the Trump campaign. Inflation, Afghanistan, the border, all the disaster under Biden. And she can't think of anything she should do differently. Has the woman not seen the right track, wrong track surveys that are out there? Yeah, not good. If you like the direction that we're going in as a country, high gas prices, high grocery bills, the high cost of insurance, going to take away your car, the gas-powered car, or healthcare costs, Kamala is definitely your gal. She's just another puppet of the failed establishment. She's Biden without the experience. A serious candidate doesn't avoid doing a real press conference and then sit down with a sex and dating podcaster. Can you tell the daddy gang when people tell you know, when people look at you and doubt you? What is that ignite in you? I don't hear no. I don't hear no. And I urge all the daddy gang, don't hear no. A serious candidate doesn't choose to attack a popular governor who's been nothing but masterful in leading a state through crises and natural disasters. Here's Kamala off the cuff. NBC has reporting governor's a fantasy ignoring your calls on hurricanes, resources, and health. How does that hurt the situation here? It's just utterly irresponsible and it is selfish and it is about political gamesmanship. Is that it's doing the job that you just know to do, which is to put the people first. Now, to call her response, dim wooded is an insult to dim wood everywhere. She's not even smart enough to know not to pick a fight with someone who's both really smart and whose state is about to get hit by the worst curve hurricane and what, a century? We've been on an emergency footing for two weeks straight, round the clock 24, 7. She has never called on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president until apparently now, while the sudden is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown any interest in the past. We know it's because of politics. We know it's because of her campaign. I have zero time to entertain these political games. Again, Kamala's hurricane smear. It's just another fumble, a fumble by a player who never should have been put on the field in the first place. She's so bad that she makes Biden seem presidential and suddenly engaged, engaged enough to let her twist in the wind. The government of Florida has been cooperative. He said he's gotten all that he needs. I talked to him again yesterday and I said, I said, no, you're doing a great job. It's been all being done well. Thank you for it. And I literally gave my personal phone number to call. Maybe Joe Biden is the one turning the page. Because even in his diminished state, he probably knows how unserious Kamala is. A serious candidate knows how to answer predictable questions. Was democracy best served by President Biden stepping down and basically handing you a nomination? You didn't have to go through a primary process. You didn't have to fight off other contenders. That's not really the way our system was intended to work. President Biden made a decision that I think history is going to show is rare among leaders. Which was to put country before self. And I am proud to have earned the support of the vast majority of delegates and to have been elected the Democratic nominee. But I think this truncated process is why people think or say they don't really know who you are. Look, I've been in this race for 70 days. It is my responsibility to earn the vote. And I'm going to work to do that. But increasingly, it looks like she's going to be relying on celebrity surrogates to do the heavy lifting for her. I would really like it if the discourse could become kinder and more effective. And I think that that will be the case with Kamala Harris and Tim Walton. Hi, I'm Bruce Brankstein. I'm supporting Kamala Harris for president and Tim Walts for vice president and opposing Donald Trump and JD Vance. Glory to the past, you're back. And you know, Democrats are desperately hoping that Taylor Swift and Obama somehow carry them to victory as well. I've even heard they're going to beg George W. Bush to endorse Kamala Harris. Well, here's the cold hard truth. Harris is simply not capable of performing the type of functions that we as Americans associate with being the president of the United States. She doesn't understand the issues at the level of detail necessary to make effective decisions. She doesn't have the type of political support necessary to bend official Washington to her will. She doesn't have the type of judgment needed to read the moods of foreign leaders. None of that. Now, the Democrats already tried having a figurehead president with Biden and it ended so badly that they fired him a few months ago. And yet now they're doing the same thing. Only she's even less serious at a time when we face countless serious challenges. And for us, that would spell serious trouble. And that's the angle."

He's the energizer, Bunny candidate, which is making the media and Democrats very, very anxious. She's got such a big problem with men. I mean, there's an under account of the Trump vote. I think there is misadjacent misadjacent in all of this. Black and white men. Big problem, but also the business world. They don't think she is serious. They don't think she's a heavyweight. Because she's not a heavyweight. Now, think about it. Since the coup against Biden, they've tried to promote her as the true change candidate. I think people are exhausted. And they're ready to turn the page and chart a new way forward. I believe in my soul and heart. The American people are ready to turn the page. I think we all know it's time to turn the page. It's time to turn the page. Well, folks, it's time to turn the page. But today, on the view, Kamala blew up her own narrative. Would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years? There is done a thing that comes to mind. Nothing that comes to mind. So much for being the change candidate. How does she not have a prepared answer for that question, by the way? Kamala Harris just wrote a devastating campaign commercial for the Trump campaign. Inflation, Afghanistan, the border, all the disaster under Biden. And she can't think of anything she should do differently. Has the woman not seen the right track, wrong track surveys that are out there? Yeah, not good. If you like the direction that we're going in as a country, high gas prices, high grocery bills, the high cost of insurance, going to take away your car, the gas-powered car, or healthcare costs, Kamala is definitely your gal. She's just another puppet of the failed establishment. She's Biden without the experience. A serious candidate doesn't avoid doing a real press conference and then sit down with a sex and dating podcaster. Can you tell the daddy gang when people tell you know, when people look at you and doubt you? What is that ignite in you? I don't hear no. I don't hear no. And I urge all the daddy gang, don't hear no. A serious candidate doesn't choose to attack a popular governor who's been nothing but masterful in leading a state through crises and natural disasters. Here's Kamala off the cuff. NBC has reporting governor's a fantasy ignoring your calls on hurricanes, resources, and health. How does that hurt the situation here? It's just utterly irresponsible and it is selfish and it is about political gamesmanship. Is that it's doing the job that you just know to do, which is to put the people first. Now, to call her response, dim wooded is an insult to dim wood everywhere. She's not even smart enough to know not to pick a fight with someone who's both really smart and whose state is about to get hit by the worst curve hurricane and what, a century? We've been on an emergency footing for two weeks straight, round the clock 24, 7. She has never called on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president until apparently now, while the sudden is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown any interest in the past. We know it's because of politics. We know it's because of her campaign. I have zero time to entertain these political games. Again, Kamala's hurricane smear. It's just another fumble, a fumble by a player who never should have been put on the field in the first place. She's so bad that she makes Biden seem presidential and suddenly engaged, engaged enough to let her twist in the wind. The government of Florida has been cooperative. He said he's gotten all that he needs. I talked to him again yesterday and I said, I said, no, you're doing a great job. It's been all being done well. Thank you for it. And I literally gave my personal phone number to call. Maybe Joe Biden is the one turning the page. Because even in his diminished state, he probably knows how unserious Kamala is. A serious candidate knows how to answer predictable questions. Was democracy best served by President Biden stepping down and basically handing you a nomination? You didn't have to go through a primary process. You didn't have to fight off other contenders. That's not really the way our system was intended to work. President Biden made a decision that I think history is going to show is rare among leaders. Which was to put country before self. And I am proud to have earned the support of the vast majority of delegates and to have been elected the Democratic nominee. But I think this truncated process is why people think or say they don't really know who you are. Look, I've been in this race for 70 days. It is my responsibility to earn the vote. And I'm going to work to do that. But increasingly, it looks like she's going to be relying on celebrity surrogates to do the heavy lifting for her. I would really like it if the discourse could become kinder and more effective. And I think that that will be the case with Kamala Harris and Tim Walton. Hi, I'm Bruce Brankstein. I'm supporting Kamala Harris for president and Tim Walts for vice president and opposing Donald Trump and JD Vance. Glory to the past, you're back. And you know, Democrats are desperately hoping that Taylor Swift and Obama somehow carry them to victory as well. I've even heard they're going to beg George W. Bush to endorse Kamala Harris. Well, here's the cold hard truth. Harris is simply not capable of performing the type of functions that we as Americans associate with being the president of the United States. She doesn't understand the issues at the level of detail necessary to make effective decisions. She doesn't have the type of political support necessary to bend official Washington to her will. She doesn't have the type of judgment needed to read the moods of foreign leaders. None of that. Now, the Democrats already tried having a figurehead president with Biden and it ended so badly that they fired him a few months ago. And yet now they're doing the same thing. Only she's even less serious at a time when we face countless serious challenges. And for us, that would spell serious trouble. And that's the angle."

I'm Laura Ingram. This is the Ingram Angle from Washington tonight. The unserious woman. That's the focus of tonight's angle. Democrats are in a box. They're trapped inside and it's a box of their own making. Slowly but surely, Kamala Harris is being exposed for what she is. An empty pantsuit. Even when obvious questions are asked, she won't answer them. You have changed your position on so many things. You were against fracking. Now you're for it. You supported Lucer immigration policies. Now you're tightening them up. You were for Medicare for all. Now you're not. So many that people don't truly know what you believe or what you stand for. And I know you've heard that. In the last four years, I have been Vice President of the United States and I have been traveling our country. And I have been listening to folks and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground. I believe in building consensus. We are a diverse people. Geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds. And what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus. Where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing. As long as you don't compromise your values. To find common sense solutions. And that has been my approach. How does that explain the flip-flopping again? Well, after this interview, Americans will understand why that the campaign had to keep her so sheltered.

Can you tell the daddy gang when people tell you know, when people look at you and doubt you? What is that ignite in you? I don't hear no. I don't hear no. And I urge all the daddy gang, don't hear no. A serious candidate doesn't choose to attack a popular governor who's been nothing but masterful in leading a state through crises and natural disasters. Here's Kamala off the cuff. NBC has reporting governor's a fantasy ignoring your calls on hurricanes, resources, and health. How does that hurt the situation here? It's just utterly irresponsible and it is selfish and it is about political gamesmanship. Is that it's doing the job that you just know to do, which is to put the people first. Now, to call her response, dim wooded is an insult to dim wood everywhere. She's not even smart enough to know not to pick a fight with someone who's both really smart and whose state is about to get hit by the worst curve hurricane and what, a century? We've been on an emergency footing for two weeks straight, round the clock 24, 7. She has never called on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president until apparently now, while the sudden is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown any interest in the past. We know it's because of politics. We know it's because of her campaign. I have zero time to entertain these political games. Again, Kamala's hurricane smear. It's just another fumble, a fumble by a player who never should have been put on the field in the first place. She's so bad that she makes Biden seem presidential and suddenly engaged, engaged enough to let her twist in the wind. The government of Florida has been cooperative. He said he's gotten all that he needs. I talked to him again yesterday and I said, I said, no, you're doing a great job. It's been all being done well. Thank you for it. And I literally gave my personal phone number to call. Maybe Joe Biden is the one turning the page. Because even in his diminished state, he probably knows how unserious Kamala is. A serious candidate knows how to answer predictable questions. Was democracy best served by President Biden stepping down and basically handing you a nomination? You didn't have to go through a primary process. You didn't have to fight off other contenders. That's not really the way our system was intended to work. President Biden made a decision that I think history is going to show is rare among leaders. Which was to put country before self. And I am proud to have earned the support of the vast majority of delegates and to have been elected the Democratic nominee. But I think this truncated process is why people think or say they don't really know who you are. Look, I've been in this race for 70 days. It is my responsibility to earn the vote. And I'm going to work to do that. But increasingly, it looks like she's going to be relying on celebrity surrogates to do the heavy lifting for her. I would really like it if the discourse could become kinder and more effective. And I think that that will be the case with Kamala Harris and Tim Walton. Hi, I'm Bruce Brankstein. I'm supporting Kamala Harris for president and Tim Walts for vice president and opposing Donald Trump and JD Vance. Glory to the past, you're back. And you know, Democrats are desperately hoping that Taylor Swift and Obama somehow carry them to victory as well. I've even heard they're going to beg George W. Bush to endorse Kamala Harris. Well, here's the cold hard truth. Harris is simply not capable of performing the type of functions that we as Americans associate with being the president of the United States. She doesn't understand the issues at the level of detail necessary to make effective decisions. She doesn't have the type of political support necessary to bend official Washington to her will. She doesn't have the type of judgment needed to read the moods of foreign leaders. None of that. Now, the Democrats already tried having a figurehead president with Biden and it ended so badly that they fired him a few months ago. And yet now they're doing the same thing. Only she's even less serious at a time when we face countless serious challenges. And for us, that would spell serious trouble. And that's the angle."

Kamala's media blitz kicked off with a total face plant. The vip struggling to answer some of the most basic questions on 60 minutes. Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did? It's a long-standing problem. And solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions. What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place? I think the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem. OK. But numbers did quadruple. After that disaster, Kamala sprinting to the gals on the view for a pep talk. But even they couldn't stop Harris from turning into a walking GOP ad. We have more with Vice President. We're honored and proud to have you at this table. If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years? There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of, and I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact. I think people are exhausted. And they're exhausted with the lies. They're exhausted with the selfishness. And the cheerleading tour didn't end there. Harris then hopped out over to Howard Stern's studio for a sit down that sounded more like a therapy session. Watch. If he wins, God forbid, would you feel safe in this country? Would you stay in this country? Howard, I'm doing everything I can to make sure he does not win. I don't understand how my fellow Americans, I don't even understand how this election is close. And yes, I'm voting for you. But I would also vote for that wall over there. You know, Dana, I'll start with you off of that last sound. You know, the amazing thing is Rachel Maddow said of Trump gets elected she won't have a show. And now Kamala is making herself just turning into a victim. I mean, do they think that this is going to cost people to vote for her as opposed to Trump? Well, ever since I can remember, and I remember when President Bush won, they said that they were going to leave the country and no one ever leaves because it's the best country. So we obviously know that's not true. Howard Stern says something interesting there that I've been hearing from other people on the right and the left saying that how could it possibly be that anybody would ever vote for that person? Well, if you're thinking that and you want your candidate to win, you better just sit down because you're not being helpful right now. The vote is going to be very, very close. So everybody needs to understand that there are people who want to vote for her. There are people that want to vote for him. And the turnout is going to matter. And that is a big, prophetic statement, isn't it? You said something that I think is interesting. She creates new ad content for her opponents every time she does TV. That happened in 2020. It got her in the penalty box at the White House. Remember, she'd do an interview then she'd basically not be seen for four or five months and she'd come out and she'd do it again. And I'm listening to Bill Whitaker who I thought did a really nice job. And I just wonder how can you work in a White House for so long and absorb so little? She couldn't answer just basic questions. And I'm going to put this on par with Katie Currick's interview with Sarah Palin. Republicans didn't want to admit it at the time, but they kind of knew in their gut. That wasn't good. This was not good for her. If you were tuning in for the first time, you know, you know, nothing about Kamala Harris. You left the interview still knowing nothing about Kamala Harris. If you know a little bit and you wanted to know a little bit more, then you were left even more sorely disappointed. And maybe you don't like President Trump, but you know who he is. And what he has done, he's got a record. She doesn't, and she doesn't even act like she's been at the White House for the last three and a half years. You know, Jessie, the truth is that David Whitaker, I mean, he did a great job. He pressed her three times on getting her to answer the question that whether it was a mistake changing the Trump era policies, the quadruple, the number of illegals coming into the country. She wouldn't answer the question. So here is a serious interview with a serious interviewer. She still doesn't answer the question. Whitaker did a job, which is his job. He didn't do a great job. He just asked her all of the questions she should have been asked for months. This is in hard stuff. Why did prices go up? Why didn't you do anything about it? Why did you do nothing on the border? She was struggling to answer why she's running for president, judge. She was struggling to answer why she's even the nominee. She has all these plans to fix the problems that she hasn't fixed in four years. Okay, that's fine. She's not the president. She's the vice president. And then she goes on the view and says, I agree with everything the president's done. Judge Janine, a week ago at the debate, she said, I'm not Joe Biden. Now she says, I am Joe Biden. She flipped, flipped, or whether she's Joe Biden. And now she comes out and says this and that. I haven't changed my positions. I'm just seeking common ground. She's not seeking common ground. She's seeking common sense. All of the positions that she's now adopted are common sense conservative positions on guns, on taxes, on immigration. She's just now come along late to the game. I'd rather vote for the guy that had common sense from the beginning than the woman who found common sense. Right before the election. It was very smart that Donald Trump didn't do 60 minutes. If he had done 60 minutes, everybody would have just contrasted his interview with hers. And his would have been explosive and confrontational. Now everybody's just talking about her failure on CBS News. And that's a position she does not want to be in. You know, Harold, she was questioned and pressed on all of her changing positions, whether it's fracking, immigration. Medicare for all. And she said people know me. They know who I am. Walt said the same thing. People know me. They know who I am. Does anyone know who either of them are? I don't know. I'm glad to be back with you. I think that a 60 minute interview. Jess, I wish the president had done former president Trump had done. I think it would probably have served him well from the standpoint of people understanding, again, what he wants to do the next four years. And it would allow for the contrast you mentioned. The reason I think presidents and candidates for presidents should always have to do three debates. And maybe we should divide it. They should do one on national security, one on economic security, inflation, and one in general. Where they talk about their attitudes, sort of regulation, the courts, etc. It's because it gives voters a sense of what the mandate might be, what they want to do, how they will go about working with Congress, how they will go about explaining things to the public. Unfortunately, we've not been afforded that. I agree with you then. I'm not going anywhere. I'm an American. No one's going to take my country from me because they decide to elect someone I don't like. And people who are that shallow are indeed that shallow. We work for the next election if that's what you want. And you work with the person to try to make things better. Finally, what I don't understand with the vice president is these interviews. You have to judge your right. You have to use these opportunities to demonstrate not only that you understand where people are in their lives, and how you're going to meet them and take them to higher ground. But talk about your ideas. I mean, wouldn't it be great if you talked about, and some people don't like when I say this, but to say that the tariffs are going to make things more expensive at stores in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and Madison was constantly named stores. If you're out campaigning, you can talk about real people that you've met, real stores that you've went in, how that's going to change the price of gas and food and clothes for kids and for adults. And if you want to say I'm going to make small businesses, make it easier for them to grow, talk about your plans.

Well, ever since I can remember, and I remember when President Bush won, they said that they were going to leave the country and no one ever leaves because it's the best country. So we obviously know that's not true. Howard Stern says something interesting there that I've been hearing from other people on the right and the left saying that how could it possibly be that anybody would ever vote for that person? Well, if you're thinking that and you want your candidate to win, you better just sit down because you're not being helpful right now. The vote is going to be very, very close. So everybody needs to understand that there are people who want to vote for her. There are people that want to vote for him. And the turnout is going to matter. And that is a big, prophetic statement, isn't it? You said something that I think is interesting. She creates new ad content for her opponents every time she does TV. That happened in 2020. It got her in the penalty box at the White House. Remember, she'd do an interview then she'd basically not be seen for four or five months and she'd come out and she'd do it again. And I'm listening to Bill Whitaker who I thought did a really nice job. And I just wonder how can you work in a White House for so long and absorb so little? She couldn't answer just basic questions. And I'm going to put this on par with Katie Currick's interview with Sarah Palin. Republicans didn't want to admit it at the time, but they kind of knew in their gut. That wasn't good. This was not good for her. If you were tuning in for the first time, you know, you know, nothing about Kamala Harris. You left the interview still knowing nothing about Kamala Harris. If you know a little bit and you wanted to know a little bit more, then you were left even more sorely disappointed. And maybe you don't like President Trump, but you know who he is. And what he has done, he's got a record. She doesn't, and she doesn't even act like she's been at the White House for the last three and a half years. You know, Jessie, the truth is that David Whitaker, I mean, he did a great job. He pressed her three times on getting her to answer the question that whether it was a mistake changing the Trump era policies, the quadruple, the number of illegals coming into the country. She wouldn't answer the question. So here is a serious interview with a serious interviewer. She still doesn't answer the question. Whitaker did a job, which is his job. He didn't do a great job. He just asked her all of the questions she should have been asked for months. This is in hard stuff. Why did prices go up? Why didn't you do anything about it? Why did you do nothing on the border? She was struggling to answer why she's running for president, judge. She was struggling to answer why she's even the nominee. She has all these plans to fix the problems that she hasn't fixed in four years. Okay, that's fine. She's not the president. She's the vice president. And then she goes on the view and says, I agree with everything the president's done. Judge Janine, a week ago at the debate, she said, I'm not Joe Biden. Now she says, I am Joe Biden. She flipped, flipped, or whether she's Joe Biden. And now she comes out and says this and that. I haven't changed my positions. I'm just seeking common ground. She's not seeking common ground. She's seeking common sense. All of the positions that she's now adopted are common sense conservative positions on guns, on taxes, on immigration. She's just now come along late to the game. I'd rather vote for the guy that had common sense from the beginning than the woman who found common sense. Right before the election. It was very smart that Donald Trump didn't do 60 minutes. If he had done 60 minutes, everybody would have just contrasted his interview with hers. And his would have been explosive and confrontational. Now everybody's just talking about her failure on CBS News. And that's a position she does not want to be in. You know, Harold, she was questioned and pressed on all of her changing positions, whether it's fracking, immigration. Medicare for all. And she said people know me. They know who I am. Walt said the same thing. People know me. They know who I am. Does anyone know who either of them are? I don't know. I'm glad to be back with you. I think that a 60 minute interview. Jess, I wish the president had done former president Trump had done. I think it would probably have served him well from the standpoint of people understanding, again, what he wants to do the next four years. And it would allow for the contrast you mentioned. The reason I think presidents and candidates for presidents should always have to do three debates. And maybe we should divide it. They should do one on national security, one on economic security, inflation, and one in general. Where they talk about their attitudes, sort of regulation, the courts, etc. It's because it gives voters a sense of what the mandate might be, what they want to do, how they will go about working with Congress, how they will go about explaining things to the public. Unfortunately, we've not been afforded that. I agree with you then. I'm not going anywhere. I'm an American. No one's going to take my country from me because they decide to elect someone I don't like. And people who are that shallow are indeed that shallow. We work for the next election if that's what you want. And you work with the person to try to make things better. Finally, what I don't understand with the vice president is these interviews. You have to judge your right. You have to use these opportunities to demonstrate not only that you understand where people are in their lives, and how you're going to meet them and take them to higher ground. But talk about your ideas. I mean, wouldn't it be great if you talked about, and some people don't like when I say this, but to say that the tariffs are going to make things more expensive at stores in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and Madison was constantly named stores. If you're out campaigning, you can talk about real people that you've met, real stores that you've went in, how that's going to change the price of gas and food and clothes for kids and for adults. And if you want to say I'm going to make small businesses, make it easier for them to grow, talk about your plans. But when you don't do that, you open yourself up for some of the, I think, legitimate criticism that's coming from this table here in legitimate concern that's coming from me.

Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did? It's a long-standing problem. And solutions are at hand. And from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions. What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place? I think the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem. OK. But numbers did quadruple. After that disaster, Kamala sprinting to the gals on the view for a pep talk. But even they couldn't stop Harris from turning into a walking GOP ad. We have more with Vice President. We're honored and proud to have you at this table. If anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years? There is not a thing that comes to mind in terms of, and I've been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact. I think people are exhausted. And they're exhausted with the lies. They're exhausted with the selfishness. And the cheerleading tour didn't end there. Harris then hopped out over to Howard Stern's studio for a sit down that sounded more like a therapy session. Watch. If he wins, God forbid, would you feel safe in this country? Would you stay in this country? Howard, I'm doing everything I can to make sure he does not win.

JD Vance shreds VP Harris for View appearance: A record to be ashamed of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nkRkiUKu0k,2024-10-08 18:55:42+00:00,Will George W. Bush endorse Kamala Harris?,0.622072160243988," be in the motor city. It's great to be in the state of Michigan. And I believe that it is in just 28 days where it has turned the state of Michigan red. Take back this country and make Donald Trump the next president of the United States. Now we are in one of the great capitals of American craftsmanship and American manufacturing. That's one of the things I love about the city of Detroit. This is one of the things I love about this community is for a generation, for many generations, the people in the state of Michigan, the people in the city of Detroit made great American products. They were proud of it and they had every single right to be. And I've already met some auto workers here today. I'm sure there are many auto workers in the audience with us right now. We're proud of you. We're grateful for you. And I promise you that when Donald Trump is back in the White House, auto workers in the city of Detroit are going to have an ally once again. Not somebody who's trying to destroy their jobs like Kamala Harris, but it's going to fight for their jobs every single day. Now I want to give a couple of shout outs here. I know we've got the great Congresswoman Lisa McLean. Lisa, thank you for being here. There we are, Lisa. Thank you. You guys have got a great Michigan GOP chair, Pete Hoax, sure. Where is Pete? Thank you, Pete. I think it was Pete who said all to me and said, I'm a little disappointed you only been in Michigan two times this week, not three times this week, Pete. We do what we can. And of course, the person I'm most thrilled to have here, no offense to anybody else, but as my lovely wife, Usha, we're so... It's a great honor and a lot of fun to be able to go around and campaign for Vice President with the most beautiful person in the world by your side, honey. I love you. Thank you for doing this. And I want to talk, because we are in a great capital of American craftsmanship. I want to talk about the fact that unfortunately we have got a leadership in this country that is trying to destroy the auto industry instead of building it. And let's just be honest about that. Under Kamala Harris, the American auto industry is suffering more than it has in at least 20 years. And I want to read off just a couple of statistics, especially for those folks who are watching at home. Here in Michigan, Stellantis announced it would permanently lay off 2,500, the Michigan auto workers, the folks who make the RAM 1500 classic, a great American automobile. Unfortunately, those Michigan auto workers lost their jobs. Last year, GM let go 1,300 workers at two Michigan plants. And we know that a lot of these companies are shipping manufacturing to Mexico and to China. Let's get back to the leadership of Donald Trump and make things in America and only in America. Now four, we see headlines consistently is rolling back a lot of its EV production. And we know that things that Kamala Harris's electric vehicle mandate 117,000 American auto jobs, a lot of them right here in Michigan are under threat. Well, here's something different. We're going to do when Donald J. Trump is president, instead of forcing Americans to buy electric vehicles, manufacturing in China, we're going to let Americans buy whatever the hell they want to because this is America. We believe in freedom. And we believe in letting people choose their own automobile. And of course, my friends, when they do pick the automobile that they want and that they choose, we know they're going to buy something made in the great state of Michigan. They're going to buy American because that's what so many Americans want. The best products. Now, I don't know if you all saw this, but I guess this morning Kamala Harris had an interview with the view. Wait a second. I am shocked that we don't have a whole lot of the view watchers here in the motor city. Sir, you don't watch Kamala Harris on the view? No. Well, I do the job sometimes that you folks don't want to. I actually watch Kamala Harris's interview on the view. Now, I'm going to tell you to go into the view as a Democrat politician. That's like the easiest interview in the entire world, right? I mean, if I walked into the view, that'd be like, well, that'd be like walking into this room with an Ohio State Jersey, right? That's something you just don't do. But she walks into the view and you would think that would be an interview and you know what they asked for? They gave her a softball and easy question. Really propaganda. They said, can you name a single thing where you disagree with Joe Biden? Now, let's back up for a second. Because remember, Kamala Harris's entire campaign is to pretend that she hasn't been the vice president for the last three and a half years. You know, she stands up before crowds and she'll say on day one, we're going to tackle the affordability crisis. On day one, we're going to secure the border and you listen to her for five minutes and you think, Kamala, are you going to vote for Donald Trump? Because you've been vice president for 14 hundred days. You haven't done anything. So you think after all this time, all this time of thinking about how she would do things differently from Joe Biden, she would have a well-prepared answer for the interviewers on the view. Will they ask her one thing you would do differently from Joe Biden? You know what she says? I can't really think of anything off the top of my head. Now, in her defense, I'm not sure she could think of anything off the top of her head, whether about Joe Biden's policies or anything else, but think about this for the last two months, Kamala Harris has been telling the American people that she's going to do things differently than Joe Biden, where she increased the cost of groceries by 25 percent. The average Michigan family has paid $1,000 more per month, that's $12,000 per year, to afford today what they could have afforded when Donald Trump was president. The border is wide open thanks to our illustrious borders are Kamala Harris, and her entire campaign has been to pretend that she doesn't bear any responsibility for the policies even though she's the sitting vice president. And here's the difference between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, there are so many of them, but the big difference is that Donald Trump has a record to be proud of, and Kamala Harris has her record to be ashamed of. You know, because when President Trump stands before a crowd, he doesn't try to pretend that he wasn't president, but she tries to pretend she wasn't the vice president. He doesn't pretend that he didn't have any decision-making authority over his own administration, because of course he did, but Kamala Harris runs from her own administration. And he know why Donald Trump isn't afraid to talk about his record. Well, number one, because he's actually honest with the American people, but most importantly, it's a record to be damn proud of, low inflation, rising take home pay, and a secure southern border. So for anybody watching at home, just ask yourself the very basic question, Kamala Harris has been in charge for four years. Are you better off than you were four years ago? And I think any honest person would say the answer is no, and you know who is certainly not better off than they were four years ago, Michigan auto workers. I mean, we just walk through thousands of job losses just in the state of Michigan because Kamala Harris would rather tax American citizens and force you to buy electric vehicles made in China. You know what Donald Trump wants to do? He wants to reward Michigan auto workers. He wants to give working people in this country a tax cut, and he wants to let Americans buy the cars that Americans want to buy. And we know when they do, they're going to buy a lot of Michigan-made automobiles. So let's just talk a little bit. We talked about manufacturing. We talked about automobiles. Let's talk about inflation. Because you know, the media they'll tell you, and this is one area where Kamala Harris, she can't quite figure out what she thinks. Because whenever they stick a microphone in front of her face, and that's rare, right? Kamala Harris very rarely does interviews, especially with hostile media, what she'll say, she'll actually brag about the fact that inflation is lower than it was when she took over. Now that's a bald face lie, and I ask anybody, think about the fact that Kamala Harris, anybody watching, think about the fact that Kamala Harris is bragging about inflation being lower. When you go to the grocery, does inflation feel like it's lower? Are American houses actually affordable for American citizens? Everywhere you look, prices are higher, things are more expensive, and American citizens can't afford the basic necessities. Look, I grew up in a family where my mammal sometimes struggled to buy the things that she needed. Sometimes she wouldn't buy prescription drugs so that she could afford to put food on our family table. I know what it's like when Washington leaders fail to do their job. And so Kamala Harris, instead of running a victory lap over your own policy failures, why don't you get it out there and talk to the American people and tell them how you're actually going to fix this terrible inflation problem caused by your policies. You know, gas prices are up 45 percent under Kamala Harris. That's just in Michigan. In Michigan, home prices are up 41 percent. I know we have a lot of parents and a lot of grandparents in this room. Speaking as the father of three young children, I would like my kids when they grow up and move out, and hopefully that eventually happens. But when they grow up and they move out, I want them to be able to afford home ownership in the United States of America. That's a core part of the American dream, right? And we know a lot of our young people right now cannot afford to own a home in the United States of America. Kamala Harris has failed to deliver the basic necessities of an economic prosperity for our citizens. And I think that we ought to say something very simple to Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is very fond of Sanit. You're fired. Go back to San Francisco, worry about long. We're getting the President of the American people to serve. I really worry, by the way, you know, we don't talk about this enough. I see we've got a lot of young people in this crowd. It's great. We've got some great generational diversity in this crowd. And I love that. I love that about our events. But it's a young people I want you to be able to own a slice of your own country. I want you to be able to build something, to build some wealth for yourself and for your family. You know, under Kamala Harris's policies, we've got credit card debt that is through the roof. We've got young people who can't afford to buy a home. We're creating a country where my generation, the millennial generation and everybody younger, they're going to be poppers in their own country. And I think that's a disgrace. I want the American dream to be affordable again. And it's only going to happen when we put Donald J. Trump back in the White House. My friends, I did not realize this. We are joined by a real celebrity, Brick Suitman, right here in the second row. And a way bigger celebrity than I am this guy. But you're going to talk about housing and the media, they don't like to talk about the fact that one of the biggest drivers of housing costs, one of the biggest reasons why our young people can't afford to buy a home is because under Kamala Harris's leadership, we have let in millions upon millions of people who don't have any right to be here. It's a big driver of housing costs. So, illegal immigration, we care about it for a whole host of reasons. We care about it because we want to raise our children in safe communities. We care about it because we want people in our country who respect the rule of law, who don't violate our borders. We of course care about it because I know a lot of us know somebody who's been affected by this terrible drug epidemic. We want to give people second chances to get sober and to get clean. And that's not happening when Mexican drug cartels are bringing fentanyl into our country, killing our people. So, we care about the border for all the reasons that we discuss and there's a lot of them. But something the media just doesn't talk enough about is think about this. When you bring in, and I think the number is about 25 million illegal aliens that we have in the United States of America right at this minute, when you let 25 million people into this country, think about it. You got to house them somewhere. Most of them are living on the streets. We got American veterans living on the streets, but we've got illegal aliens living in first class hotels and American cities all across our country. But when you do that, you have American homes that are going to people who have no right to be here in the first place. And you know what that means? That means American citizens can't afford to own a slice of their own country. President Trump believes in this very simple principle, American homes for American citizens, not for people who have no legal rights to be in the United States of America. You know something else that happens when you let into many legal aliens, hospital wait times get really big. You know when I was growing up, that's often how we went to the doctor as maimol would take us to the emergency room. And you know what, emergency room wait times have skyrocketed in the last few years. So why are we allowing illegal aliens to come into our country and get healthcare that all by right go to American citizens? Why don't we take care of our own people and put American citizens first for a change? It's got to stop. The final thing I want to talk about with the border because it mean look you can talk about the border for the next half hour. But the other thing that is crazy about the border is in the state of Michigan, I didn't know the statistic until today. There are 85,000 students in Michigan public schools who are the children of illegal aliens. 85,000. Now think about that. Think about what it does to a poor school teacher who's just trying to get by with what they have is trying to educate their kids and then you drop in a few dozen kids into that school many of whom don't even speak English. Do you think that's good for the education of the American citizens? No it's not. So what really bothers me is when Kamala Harris talks about the southern border she talks about how we need to be compassionate to illegal aliens. And look I think we're a great country we can be compassionate and we ought to be compassionate but our compassion has to start with our fellow citizens, the people who deserve to be in the United States to begin with. And this is what I think is fundamentally different about Donald Trump's immigration policies versus Kamala Harris's wide open southern border. Is Donald Trump believes yes we can be compassionate but the best way to be compassionate is to enforce our border laws and take care of American citizens first. That is where the responsibility of America's leadership ought to be. So I want to talk about one other thing and then we'll take some questions from the press but we've got 28 or depending on how you count 27 days left in this election. That is not a whole lot of time. And I know that in states all across our country including in some of the battleground states people are already voting. You know people have already been sending me photos where they went out and voted for me and President Trump. That's obviously an incredible honor by the way to come from my family and to be sitting up here and to ask in all of you to make me your next Vice President of the United States. It's very humbling. It's an incredible honor. Thank you. Now y'all are way too kind. I appreciate it. But look what we look we're going to win this election. I really do believe we're going to win the state of Michigan. We're going to win this election but we're going to win this election not just to beat the Democrats as fun as that's going to be. I'm going to really enjoy beaten Kamala Harris. But we want to beat Kamala Harris because we want the American people to have a government that they deserve. A government that puts them first, a government that takes care of the American people's problems and not the problems of illegal aliens and people who don't deserve to be here. So let's just think about the contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. We talked about a legal immigration earlier. Well Kamala Harris has rolled out the red carpet to illegal aliens. He said we're going to give Medicare and Social Security benefits. That's the message that she has sent to people who want to cross the border illegally and come to this country. You know what Donald Trump's message is to illegal aliens? You got four months pack your bags because you're going home when Donald Trump is back in the White House. Kamala Harris's entire economic policy is to tax American citizens and to force them to buy things they don't even want to buy that are made overseas. That's terrible for American workers. That's terrible for American taxpayers. Donald Trump's plan is to cut taxes on American citizens, cut taxes on American workers, and penalize corporations that are shipping our jobs overseas. That is an America first economic plan. Donald Trump's basic energy policy is drill, baby drill, and it is a hell of an energy policy because look we have got the most boundful natural resources anywhere in the world. So why does Kamala Harris want to put American energy workers out of business and force us to buy energy from 10 pot dictators all over the world? Let's buy it from our own people from our own territory and that's how you build American prosperity. And that's actually by the way my friends another big difference between Donald Trump's policies and Kamala Harris's policies. You know when they ask Donald Trump what is your most important thing you can do to lower inflation? He actually gives a very simple but a very specific answer, drill baby drill because because energy goes into the cost of everything right? Think about it. If the truck drivers are paying more for gas then the groceries they deliver to the grocery store are going to get more expensive. If the truck drivers are paying more for diesel then they deliver lumber to a job site to build a house that means housing is going to get more expensive too. And of course we know ask any manufacturer one of their biggest costs is the cost of energy. So you lower the cost of energy, you create good jobs, you create great prosperity and you bring down the cost of goods for everyday American citizens. It is a win-win economic policy. It is the smartest and most important thing we can do. But Kamala Harris's economic policy, your herter state on the view today is to do exactly what Joe Biden did and it is going to lead to the exact same place. Higher inflation, fewer Americans with good jobs and a manufacturing sector that were shipped into China instead of building right here in the great city of Detroit. That is a lose-lose economic plan and I think we ought to have the win-win economic plan of Donald J. Trump. So before I take questions from the foreers I want to ask a very simple thing. Absentee voting has started in Michigan that means that you can request and return a ballot right now. And we got to do everything. We got to take care of every opportunity to vote that the state of Michigan is providing because look I talk to a lot of people, it is one of the things you do when you run for vice president. You talk to a lot of people and you know 95% of the people I meet will say I wanted to vote for Donald Trump in 2020 and I did. But then a few of them will tell me I wanted to vote for Donald Trump but I didn't because I planned to vote on election day but then my kid got sick and I had to pick go pick him up from school or I had a really late day at work and I didn't expect it and so by the time I got out of work you know working those overtime hours the polls were already closed. I gotta be honest with you I don't like the fact that we've gone from election day to election season in this country but it is what it is. And if the Democrats are going to take advantage of every avenue to vote then Republicans we've got to do it too so get out there make your voice heard and get out there and vote. There's a website I want you to take down and I ask you to do two things here. Number one take down this website swampthevoteusa.com swampthevoteusa.com. On that website you can check your registration you can check your polling location you can make sure your registration is up to date that is a very good resource for you to use. The other thing I want you to do is I want you to take out your phone and take a photo right now you can take it of you and your friends at this event you can take it of me up here in the podium this is making the secret service very nervous by the way so please move slowly my friends but here's the thing we're never going to have the power of the dishonest national media behind us but we do have people power we can talk about why we're voting for Donald Trump and we can do it in our capacity as citizens of this country so I'm sure you all have some social media or maybe just text whether you do email text put it on x.com put it on Facebook put it on Instagram just say why you're voting for Donald Trump for president because if every single person does that and a hundred people see what you put out there then that means thousands upon thousands of people are going to hear the truth about Donald J Trump and not the dishonesty from the media that is the biggest and best thing that we can do. So before we hit the road we'll take some questions from reporters I want to thank you all for being here thanks for having me I'll leave you with some final thoughts but it's such an honor to be here and to get this welcome in the motor city God bless you all thank you so much. All right all right so let me take let me take a few questions from reporters I'll answer them and then and then we'll have to hit the road but we got a microphone I sure we're passing around over there yeah go ahead great this is Claire and I'm with the Detroit Free Press we're in the city of Detroit today where we learned in a recent Jack Smith filing that the Trump campaign aid in 2020 allegedly urge supporters to riot at the ballot counting center so I want to make sure that the senator can hear my question which is would you discourage the campaign from engaging in that behavior and from Trump supporters engaging in chaotic scene so let me let me answer that question a few different ways so so first of all first of all of course we discourage rioting we do not riot nobody in this room and nobody in this movement is gonna riot second of all your question is about a Trump campaign staffer and I'll tell you that if you get a thousand people together and the Trump campaign probably has a lot more than a thousand campaign staffers you're gonna find somebody who's willing to say anything especially in a leaked a leaked message or private communication the idea that the Trump campaign either in 2020 or 2024 is encouraging people to riot is disgraceful of course we're not doing that and by the way and and by the way these fine people are law abiding citizens who work and pay their taxes they're not gonna riot no matter what anybody says to him and here's here's here's the final point I think it's interesting that the media is so focused on a random message from a random staffer in 2020 if you want to talk about rioting let's talk about the summer riots of 2020 that killed 20 people that the media seems uninterested in next next question hello my name is Sasha Calver I'm a reporter with the Michigan Daily so the University of Michigan all campuses have historically had some of the largest student voter turnout in the US why should students in Michigan cast their vote for the Trump fancied ticket and additionally how will your administration support students specifically concerning gun violence where you've rejected calls for tougher gun laws and bans on bumpstunks essentially why should students concerned about their safety on campus vote for you yes so the first the first let's be honest here I don't know I don't know if a Ohio State graduate is the best messenger to University of Michigan students so I hope and and and and back thank you sir you know maybe we should just get we should get a clip of me saying something nice about Kamala Harris out to University of Michigan because then maybe that all vote for Donald J Trump if you just told him I was a buck I like I you know I'm always a little nervous about injecting myself into the OSU Michigan rivalry here but I think that we all all kidding aside look we all care about the country and that's why I think every person in this room is going to help me make Donald J Trump the next president of the United States and it's in that spirit that I want to answer this question if I'm a if I'm a young person in Michigan here here's one thing that Donald Trump and I want to do first of all we want to make it easier for you to build a life and to have a good career and to have a good job in your home not to ship all the good jobs over to seize but to build a great middle class economy right here in the United States of America I think that's something that matters to a lot of Michigan students I think the second thing that matters to Michigan students is I don't want young people in this country to be permanently indebted because we built an economy that turns American citizens into poppers in their own country I want them to be able to own a home build some wealth for themselves and start a family right here in the state of Michigan and do it and do it because we've got smarter economic policies that are going to allow them to thrive Michigan students people who are meaning at the University of Michigan and all across the state because I know there's a lot of great universities in the state of Michigan we are turning an entire generation of American young people into folks who don't have enough money to own anything that is a terribly destructive direction for this country to go in Donald Trump and I want you to be able to own a slice of your own country and we're going to pursue economic policies that make that possible that's what we're going to fight for every single day and on and on the question about gun violence what I have said is that 90% upwards of 90% of the gun crime that's committed in this country is committed using an illegally obtained firearm so my point is making it unlawful to own that gun has not stopped 90% of these gun crimes so what we've got to do is take some common sense security measures and I think the best way to reduce gun crime in the United States of America I don't think this I think this is a statistical fact is to lock up people who are committing violence against their fellow citizens that's the most important thing and I you know I'm going to butcher the statistics so I don't want to give them exactly but if you look whether it's in Detroit or New York City any of our major cities and you look at the violence problem it is always a very very small number of people who commit the gross majority of violent crimes so why don't we get back in this country whether your whatever your racial background is whatever whether you're rich or poor get back to locking up that small number of violent criminals it'll make everybody safer everybody more secure and it'll actually give people public safety and I think that's the biggest way we can reduce violent crime in this country thank you next question senator vance can Coleman from michiganadvance.com uh Detroit is 77% African-American uh the state is 14% African-American why should African-American Michigan Anders vote for the Trump fans ticket. Well you know we've we've we've got we've got a great number of black Americans in this crowd right now they could probably answer that question better than I could but but but but but without calling everybody up here because I'm a politician I don't like to share the microphone with anybody as much as I like them what what I think they would agree with is number one Donald Trump wants to bring back public safety and an economy that brings prosperity for everybody good wages for good jobs that's the Trump promise and I think that's a great promise uh to black families in michigan and to everybody else here here's something else I mean there is this idea in the media and I don't know where it came from that somehow black Americans don't believe in public safety in this country well we know whether your Democrat Republican or independent black Americans do care about public safety in this country they want to empower our law enforcement officers to do their job of course do it respectfully and make sure we've got good relationships between police and community but we can have a good relationship between police and the communities they serve while we lock up the violent criminals and keep everybody safe in the process I think that's very possible and look I mean the the story of black Americans especially in a city of Detroit is actually very similar to the story of Appalachian white Americans who came from West Virginia Kentucky Tennessee we moved to places like Detroit black and white together because there were good jobs for people who were willing to work hard and play by the rules and it wasn't always perfect but for a generation in this country people black and white work together raise their families built things in this country and create a prosperity for the entire country and if you that that was the story by the way in the steel mill that my grandfather worked in for almost 40 years you had black folks and white folks living together working together and they they again it wasn't always perfect but it worked you know why it worked because we had good jobs for people who were willing to work hard and play by the rules the destruction of the manufacturing economy in the state of Michigan has been disastrous for black Americans and it's been disastrous for a lot of middle class white Americans too we can make things in this country again we can build things in the United States of America again and what we do is going to bring prosperity to black and white alike next question good afternoon Senator Bans my name is John E. Not from a Vante moda magazine and I'm a member of the local independent media here in Detroit so hopefully I'll get a little safer reception I'm a native Detroiter and I think Michiganders are really worried about a lot of things during this election cycle and I think a couple that I hear all the time is very nervous about their first amendment and their second amendment rights so the question is what will the Trump administration do to guarantee that people of Michigan that their rights will be protected and what's your view on those those amendments and then also to what extent should social media companies if any be able to moderate and control what people say online if it's legal yeah so let me let me try to answer that question as completely as I can number one I love the first and second amendments there's a reason their number one and number two is because they're the most important but you know you go back to the question gentleman asked earlier about black Americans and particularly what black Michiganders have to gain from a Trump presidency and if you look at the censorship and the vaccine mandates the idea that you should be fired from your job for speaking your mind that fell oftentimes hardest on black Americans as much as anybody else because it was often black Americans who are going on and saying well wait a second you know what why and again this is everybody but it was happening a lot in the black community why are we forced to take this shot in order to earn a living and provide bread for our children why are we being silenced by some of the biggest corporations in the United States of America I think that affects everybody but your answer about your question about technology companies the biggest threat to the first amendment in the United States of America is big technology companies who are trying to silence Americans for speaking their mind and the Trump campaign and the Trump presidency we've got no use for it and you guys about the second amendment look I believe we believe in the second amendment we believe that people ought to be able to keep their families and their children safe and it's that simple and I think there is a big difference between the Kamala Harris campaign Kamala Harris is explicitly endorsed gun confiscation Donald Trump has explicitly endorsed the second amendment of the U.S. Constitution I'd rather be on that side hi this is Jordan here with Nlive and Ann Arbor news you've talked a lot about like EVs and that kind of stuff today what would you say to voters who maybe agree with a lot of your policies but are concerned about climate change and environmental impact of the automotive ministry so here's what I'd say Sarah and I appreciate the question so first of all the most important thing that we can do to ensure clean air and clean water is to build more and make more stuff in the United States of America that is the biggest thing if look I would be lying to you if I told you that carbon emissions were was my number one issue okay it's not but if your number one issue is carbon emissions look at the two countries that have admitted the most carbon in the last 20 30 years it's China and it's India make more stuff in the United States of America that's how you make sure we have clean air and clean water and Kamala Harris policies have done the opposite the other thing I'd say to folks who are worried about the environment is is look I'm worried about the environment too but here's what I really worry about I worry about our food supply like what has gone wrong with our food supply that we have got an obesity epidemic in this country unlike we've ever seen in the history of the world that really worries me what are we putting you know we have all of these weird childhood diseases that we did not have three five third you know three decades ago five decades ago does that suggest that we're putting too much weird stuff in our water or too much weird stuff in our food supply you know what one of the people that I'm really proud has endorsed this campaign is Bobby Kennedy Jr. and I say that as and I say that as somebody who was raised by blue collar Democrats right the people who would have been Democrats in the 60s and 70s in this town those folks have been abandoned by Kamala Harris as Democratic Party but Bobby Kennedy has this slogan that is so true and has a lot of there's a lot of real depth built into it make America healthy again we I mean you you look at our young people we have skyrocketing rates of of mental health problems in the in the United States of America we use five times as much antidepressants as some of our peer countries in the world why are Americans five times as depressed as some of these other countries I think it suggests that we've got to do a better job at real environmental protection not the fake Kamala Harris environmental protection which apparently the only thing it means is ship all of our jobs to China let's make Americans healthy again let's make our water cleaner and our air cleaner and that's something Donald Trump but I believe in okay thank you senator historian with CBS news you said in an interview with newsmax yesterday that that uh FEMA was disaster relief was being used to uh fund migrate to focus on migrants rather Donald Trump also said on true social that most if not all of the money that FEMA spent is on migrants uh FEMA officials say that's just not true what evidence do you guys have to suggest that so here's here's here's here's the evidence and by the way I just want to make an observation about about these these these reporters and I appreciate the question is you know when when people say that they feel endangered by a crowd voicing their opinion well look my friends the first amendment goes in both directions and so you haven't made this criticism to be clear but but I I read some article it was in some I forget who published it but they were like well journalists don't feel safe and at some of our events look not a single person here is going to harm you they're just going to speak their mind and they have every right to do it so god bless you guys the first amendment we believe in it in this country but but sir my point is about the focus of our current administration and if you use resources but most importantly if you put people on the task of dealing let's say with a massive influx of illegal immigration then they're going to be distracted from doing their core job of keeping American safe in response to a disaster each of us this is true of me it's true of everybody in the world we only got so much time to focus and there's only so much time in the day and if you take FEMA and you turn it into an agency that resettles illegal immigrants that's going to take their focus away from keeping people safe after a hurricane that's basic human reality and I think there's no way around it now now what the fact checkers saying we'll sort of you know we'll try to be as fair to the other side as possible my friends what the fact checkers will say as well there's a bucket of money that goes to illegal immigrants and there's that's a different bucket of money that goes to disaster relief well I'm sure the Biden administration has never moved money from one bucket to the other and three and a half years and three and a half years we know that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are more than willing to move money from one bucket to another if it suits their purpose they ought to be moving money to the bucket that supports American citizens and the wake of these terrible storms that's what I would like them to do but the the final point I want to make about this is just bureaucratic focus look I've seen a lot of wild stuff out there on the internet the problem with what I've seen from the Biden administration is that they're not focused on getting resources to people that need it when Kamala Harris is out at his fundraiser in San Francisco meanwhile North Carolina is drowning North Carolinians have every right to say where the hell is our vice president and why is it she focused on us that focus is got to change the 82nd Airborne and this is in 2010 you're never going to hear me praise Barack Obama you rarely hear me praise Barack Obama but in 2010 there was a terrible earthquake in Port-Aprints Haiti a ton of people lost their lives a ton of people had their livelihoods destroyed the 82nd Airborne was in Port-Aprints Haiti under Barack Obama 48 hours later North Carolina is an hour away from the 82nd Airborne's headquarters why did it take a week to get the 82nd Airborne on the ground helping American citizens it's disgraceful go ahead ma'am and hello senator andre Ashilal with Reuters I have two questions for you one is sure but both of them are local so one of them is that senator Sanders was at a rally on Saturday and he talked about is this Bernie Bernie yes so I actually like Bernie he's kind of like a grumpy old man I like Bernie go ahead well so he brought up the comments that you've made where you've he said you declined to honor the commitment or to say if the Trump administration would honor the commitment to invest $500 million in the GM plant and to convert the Cadillac plant to EVs I wonder if you can just clear that up for us and then the other question has to do with the very large population of Arab and Muslim Americans here in the area and I'm wondering whether you're going to meet with them I know that several mayors for instance the mayor of him-traumat have endorsed your campaign but but just yesterday president Trump former president Trump said that he had been to Gaza later a campaign staffer said that he had been to Israel and Gaza is in Israel which is not true I wonder if you could just say a few words about Gaza and also why you think air of Americans and Muslims would would do better by voting for your campaign thanks well because let me answer the first question first so neither mean or president Trump has ever said that we want to take any money that's going to Michigan auto workers out of the state of Michigan we certainly want to invest in Michigan auto workers as much as possible what we've said is that Kamala Harris is offering table scraps $500 million when you have an EV mandate that's going to cost $117,000 auto worker jobs I think that Michigan auto workers deserve more than the table scraps at Kamala Harris's Green New Scam that's what we're talking about and and again you know you talk to auto makers you talk to the manufacturers they'll tell you that electric vehicles are sitting on the lots for 90 days for 120 days meanwhile the gas powered cars are sitting on the lots for 15 days or 20 days if you force Americans to buy electric vehicles they don't want that are made in China you are going to throw this entire state into poverty and Donald Trump and I will not stand for we're going to fight for these people we're going to fight for their jobs we're going to fight for their prosperity now the second question about Arab Americans I mean look we're thrilled to have the mayor's support and and I'm not meeting to your question I'm not meeting any Arab American or Muslim American leaders on this particular trip though we certainly will in future trips to Michigan you all are getting sick of me I'm going to be in Michigan like you know 30 times the next 28 days and to be clear for the fact checkers when I said I would be in Michigan 30 times that was a slight exaggeration that was something that was exaggeration used to affect it'll probably be like six or seven times over the next of the next 27 days but look I think I think the reason why and and this is one of these issues where obviously Arab Americans often have different views than Jewish Americans on what's going on in Israel what's going on in Palestine but I think both Jewish Americans and Arab Americans recognize that what's in the best interest of Israel and Palestine is peace and Donald J. Trump was the president of peace and I really think that's it you know I saw I saw I saw Kamala Harris said the other day that the biggest threat to the United States of America is Iran and look I think Iran's a big threat but Iran is nothing compared to China China is the biggest threat confronting this country but I think I think man it revealed that Kamala Harris seems to be totally fine with starting or escalating a conflict in every continent all over the world Donald Trump believes peace through strength stop the killing get Americans out of harm's way and focus on building a peaceful globe that is how you help Palestinians that's how you help Israelis but most importantly it's how you help American citizens is peace we'll do a couple more than we'll have to hit the road sir James Dixon New York Post when I was a kid Detroit was the king of manufacturing right in that time China and Mexico their rise has come on Detroit's decline how do you make Detroit build again what can you do from the White House so two big things first of all it goes back to President Trump's I think it's most simple but also his most specific public policy drill baby drill we what the big advantage the big advantage we have over China over Russia over any manufacturer is that we could have effectively free energy right here in the United States of America unleash American energy workers and we'll manufacture much more but here here's something and this is something that is a real real problem for Kamala Harris she attacks Donald Trump when Donald Trump says that he wants to impose tariffs to protect the jobs of American workers we'll think about this let's say for example that you want you want to manufacture in China and the wage in China because sometimes they're employing literal slaves in China actual slave laborers is three dollars a day so you can make a product in China paying somebody three dollars a day using a literal slave and then you bring that product into the United States of America that is the destruction of American manufacturing because Americans won't and most importantly American should not be expected to compete with Chinese slave laborers they deserve to have a good life in their own country and the only the only way to protect them from those Chinese companies using slave laborers is to say if you want to come back into the United States you're going to pay a big fat tariff before you do it that is an important part of our pro manufacturing policy and anybody anybody who tells you you can bring back American manufacturing without penalizing companies that are using slave laborers they are lying to you let's get real let's penalize the people using slave laborers let's reward the folks using American workers to build great products do one more question thank you senator I wanted to ask you about Bob Woodward's new reporting specifically about Trump and Putin's calls have you had conversations with the former president about his relationship with Putin and what those calls entailed I honestly didn't know that Bob Woodward was still alive until you just asked me that question that's what what little I know about Bob Woodward is that he is I'm going to use I'm going to use a word here he is a hack the guy's a hack so have I have I talked to Donald Trump about his calls with Vladimir Putin know I've never had that conversation with Donald Trump in my life but if Donald Trump even if it's true look is there something wrong with speaking to world leaders no is there anything wrong with engaging in diplomacy what Kamala Harris' approach has been to hide an abacement hide from the American people and hide from world leaders and you know what that's gotten us we're on the verge of world war three it's a disgrace and it's a complete failure of a foreign policy what what are my favorite Donald Trump moments of his first presidency you all you all may remember this but do you know Kim Jong-un he's you know he's the leader of North Korea and let's be honest Kim Jong-un hasn't skipped many meals okay so Donald Trump goes to Kim Jong-un and all you know he meets with them and all the photographers come in and and and President Trump looks at the photographers and he says all right everybody make us look good make us look very thin and and Kim Jong-un shoots up like this you know it's kind of kind of offended a little bit but what what it showed is Donald Trump's I'm not you know I see a lot of you laughing but I'm not just trying to make fun of Kim Jong-un the point is you have to go and talk to people you have to be willing to engage in diplomacy engage in conversations that's how you keep the world from falling into disarray and war and Donald Trump was better at it than anybody over the last 50 years we'll do we'll do we'll do one more we'll do one more here if we can I know I said I said that was the last one but this guy really wants to ask me a question it better be a good one man because you're thank you senator I represent Polish media dozecha conservative media Poland is the best ally America ever had in Europe it's a great no that that's right beautiful speech of Donald Trump in 2019 in Warsaw sir Kamala Harris claims that Polish American Catholics with vote for Harris world take it what is your message to Polish American Catholics and Catholics all together well she she said it better than I could my message is vote Trump and and make sure everybody in no vote Trump look Kamala Harris has been the biggest disaster for religious liberty in the history of this country Kamala Harris she wants to force Catholic nuns to engage in procedures that violate those Catholic nuns conscience Donald Trump and I think we're a big enough country to let Catholic nuns live their lives as they choose and to live out their values as fully as they want to Kamala Harris has tried to make it so that religious organizations can't do the things that they want to do Donald Trump and I love our churches and want to empower them to minister to people because we think that the best people to minister are those on the ground support in our fellow citizens and making their lives more blessed and easier and Donald Trump when he was president you know who Vladimir Putin was invading nobody nobody under the leadership of Donald Trump Vladimir Putin kept in his own country which is where we'd like to keep him under the policies of Kamala Harris Vladimir Putin seems to want to invade a lot of people and so if you're a Polish Catholic if you're a Polish American if you just care about common sense foreign policy and you want religious people to be able to live their faith Donald Trump is the only ticket in town vote Trump for religious freedom vote Trump for prosperity vote Trump for world peace so that that unfortunately is going to be the last question but let me leave you with one final thought you know I got to say to you other than other than and raising a family with this this beautiful person to my right here the greatest honor of my life is to be able to run for vice president of the United States it is the coolest thing you get to see this country in a totally different light I mean Michigan one of these reporters asked me earlier when we were doing a private conversation backstage she said every time you come to town the weather is good in Michigan and I guess my I guess my response is Michigan elect me vice president I'll come to town all the time that will keep Michigan weather looking pretty good but this is the most beautiful country anywhere in the world we have the best natural resources natural resources that the Russians the Chinese would literally kill for and on top of it we've got the most gracious and most generous people anywhere in the world I really do believe that I you know I I will meet people who tell me that they're struggling to buy groceries under Kamala Harris's economy but then they'll spend 30 seconds telling me about their life and then they'll spend three minutes telling me that they're praying for my family and asking me how I'm doing and what that teaches me what that teaches me is that we have a generosity of spirit in the United States of America that though we have bad leadership it is never going to destroy what makes this country great in the first place and that's our people that's all of you and I'm so grateful to you but what I do really worry is that this country is never going to be able to live to its full potential with the broken leadership of Kamala Harris groceries are never going to be affordable if we have the broken leadership of Kamala Harris we're not going to have peace in the in the world if we have the broken leadership of Kamala Harris so over the next 27 days what I'd ask you all to do is to do everything that you can to give the American people a president who is fit to lead and fit to serve this great country elect Donald J Trump let's go get it done let's do it together and let's take this country back God bless you all"
JD Vance shreds VP Harris for View appearance: A record to be ashamed of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nkRkiUKu0k,2024-10-08 18:55:42+00:00,Will Kamala Harris drop out of presidential race?,0.6142688393592834," be in the motor city. It's great to be in the state of Michigan. And I believe that it is in just 28 days where it has turned the state of Michigan red. Take back this country and make Donald Trump the next president of the United States. Now we are in one of the great capitals of American craftsmanship and American manufacturing. That's one of the things I love about the city of Detroit. This is one of the things I love about this community is for a generation, for many generations, the people in the state of Michigan, the people in the city of Detroit made great American products. They were proud of it and they had every single right to be. And I've already met some auto workers here today. I'm sure there are many auto workers in the audience with us right now. We're proud of you. We're grateful for you. And I promise you that when Donald Trump is back in the White House, auto workers in the city of Detroit are going to have an ally once again. Not somebody who's trying to destroy their jobs like Kamala Harris, but it's going to fight for their jobs every single day. Now I want to give a couple of shout outs here. I know we've got the great Congresswoman Lisa McLean. Lisa, thank you for being here. There we are, Lisa. Thank you. You guys have got a great Michigan GOP chair, Pete Hoax, sure. Where is Pete? Thank you, Pete. I think it was Pete who said all to me and said, I'm a little disappointed you only been in Michigan two times this week, not three times this week, Pete. We do what we can. And of course, the person I'm most thrilled to have here, no offense to anybody else, but as my lovely wife, Usha, we're so... It's a great honor and a lot of fun to be able to go around and campaign for Vice President with the most beautiful person in the world by your side, honey. I love you. Thank you for doing this. And I want to talk, because we are in a great capital of American craftsmanship. I want to talk about the fact that unfortunately we have got a leadership in this country that is trying to destroy the auto industry instead of building it. And let's just be honest about that. Under Kamala Harris, the American auto industry is suffering more than it has in at least 20 years. And I want to read off just a couple of statistics, especially for those folks who are watching at home. Here in Michigan, Stellantis announced it would permanently lay off 2,500, the Michigan auto workers, the folks who make the RAM 1500 classic, a great American automobile. Unfortunately, those Michigan auto workers lost their jobs. Last year, GM let go 1,300 workers at two Michigan plants. And we know that a lot of these companies are shipping manufacturing to Mexico and to China. Let's get back to the leadership of Donald Trump and make things in America and only in America. Now four, we see headlines consistently is rolling back a lot of its EV production. And we know that things that Kamala Harris's electric vehicle mandate 117,000 American auto jobs, a lot of them right here in Michigan are under threat. Well, here's something different. We're going to do when Donald J. Trump is president, instead of forcing Americans to buy electric vehicles, manufacturing in China, we're going to let Americans buy whatever the hell they want to because this is America. We believe in freedom. And we believe in letting people choose their own automobile. And of course, my friends, when they do pick the automobile that they want and that they choose, we know they're going to buy something made in the great state of Michigan. They're going to buy American because that's what so many Americans want. The best products. Now, I don't know if you all saw this, but I guess this morning Kamala Harris had an interview with the view. Wait a second. I am shocked that we don't have a whole lot of the view watchers here in the motor city. Sir, you don't watch Kamala Harris on the view? No. Well, I do the job sometimes that you folks don't want to. I actually watch Kamala Harris's interview on the view. Now, I'm going to tell you to go into the view as a Democrat politician. That's like the easiest interview in the entire world, right? I mean, if I walked into the view, that'd be like, well, that'd be like walking into this room with an Ohio State Jersey, right? That's something you just don't do. But she walks into the view and you would think that would be an interview and you know what they asked for? They gave her a softball and easy question. Really propaganda. They said, can you name a single thing where you disagree with Joe Biden? Now, let's back up for a second. Because remember, Kamala Harris's entire campaign is to pretend that she hasn't been the vice president for the last three and a half years. You know, she stands up before crowds and she'll say on day one, we're going to tackle the affordability crisis. On day one, we're going to secure the border and you listen to her for five minutes and you think, Kamala, are you going to vote for Donald Trump? Because you've been vice president for 14 hundred days. You haven't done anything. So you think after all this time, all this time of thinking about how she would do things differently from Joe Biden, she would have a well-prepared answer for the interviewers on the view. Will they ask her one thing you would do differently from Joe Biden? You know what she says? I can't really think of anything off the top of my head. Now, in her defense, I'm not sure she could think of anything off the top of her head, whether about Joe Biden's policies or anything else, but think about this for the last two months, Kamala Harris has been telling the American people that she's going to do things differently than Joe Biden, where she increased the cost of groceries by 25 percent. The average Michigan family has paid $1,000 more per month, that's $12,000 per year, to afford today what they could have afforded when Donald Trump was president. The border is wide open thanks to our illustrious borders are Kamala Harris, and her entire campaign has been to pretend that she doesn't bear any responsibility for the policies even though she's the sitting vice president. And here's the difference between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, there are so many of them, but the big difference is that Donald Trump has a record to be proud of, and Kamala Harris has her record to be ashamed of. You know, because when President Trump stands before a crowd, he doesn't try to pretend that he wasn't president, but she tries to pretend she wasn't the vice president. He doesn't pretend that he didn't have any decision-making authority over his own administration, because of course he did, but Kamala Harris runs from her own administration. And he know why Donald Trump isn't afraid to talk about his record. Well, number one, because he's actually honest with the American people, but most importantly, it's a record to be damn proud of, low inflation, rising take home pay, and a secure southern border. So for anybody watching at home, just ask yourself the very basic question, Kamala Harris has been in charge for four years. Are you better off than you were four years ago? And I think any honest person would say the answer is no, and you know who is certainly not better off than they were four years ago, Michigan auto workers. I mean, we just walk through thousands of job losses just in the state of Michigan because Kamala Harris would rather tax American citizens and force you to buy electric vehicles made in China. You know what Donald Trump wants to do? He wants to reward Michigan auto workers. He wants to give working people in this country a tax cut, and he wants to let Americans buy the cars that Americans want to buy. And we know when they do, they're going to buy a lot of Michigan-made automobiles. So let's just talk a little bit. We talked about manufacturing. We talked about automobiles. Let's talk about inflation. Because you know, the media they'll tell you, and this is one area where Kamala Harris, she can't quite figure out what she thinks. Because whenever they stick a microphone in front of her face, and that's rare, right? Kamala Harris very rarely does interviews, especially with hostile media, what she'll say, she'll actually brag about the fact that inflation is lower than it was when she took over. Now that's a bald face lie, and I ask anybody, think about the fact that Kamala Harris, anybody watching, think about the fact that Kamala Harris is bragging about inflation being lower. When you go to the grocery, does inflation feel like it's lower? Are American houses actually affordable for American citizens? Everywhere you look, prices are higher, things are more expensive, and American citizens can't afford the basic necessities. Look, I grew up in a family where my mammal sometimes struggled to buy the things that she needed. Sometimes she wouldn't buy prescription drugs so that she could afford to put food on our family table. I know what it's like when Washington leaders fail to do their job. And so Kamala Harris, instead of running a victory lap over your own policy failures, why don't you get it out there and talk to the American people and tell them how you're actually going to fix this terrible inflation problem caused by your policies. You know, gas prices are up 45 percent under Kamala Harris. That's just in Michigan. In Michigan, home prices are up 41 percent. I know we have a lot of parents and a lot of grandparents in this room. Speaking as the father of three young children, I would like my kids when they grow up and move out, and hopefully that eventually happens. But when they grow up and they move out, I want them to be able to afford home ownership in the United States of America. That's a core part of the American dream, right? And we know a lot of our young people right now cannot afford to own a home in the United States of America. Kamala Harris has failed to deliver the basic necessities of an economic prosperity for our citizens. And I think that we ought to say something very simple to Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is very fond of Sanit. You're fired. Go back to San Francisco, worry about long. We're getting the President of the American people to serve. I really worry, by the way, you know, we don't talk about this enough. I see we've got a lot of young people in this crowd. It's great. We've got some great generational diversity in this crowd. And I love that. I love that about our events. But it's a young people I want you to be able to own a slice of your own country. I want you to be able to build something, to build some wealth for yourself and for your family. You know, under Kamala Harris's policies, we've got credit card debt that is through the roof. We've got young people who can't afford to buy a home. We're creating a country where my generation, the millennial generation and everybody younger, they're going to be poppers in their own country. And I think that's a disgrace. I want the American dream to be affordable again. And it's only going to happen when we put Donald J. Trump back in the White House. My friends, I did not realize this. We are joined by a real celebrity, Brick Suitman, right here in the second row. And a way bigger celebrity than I am this guy. But you're going to talk about housing and the media, they don't like to talk about the fact that one of the biggest drivers of housing costs, one of the biggest reasons why our young people can't afford to buy a home is because under Kamala Harris's leadership, we have let in millions upon millions of people who don't have any right to be here. It's a big driver of housing costs. So, illegal immigration, we care about it for a whole host of reasons. We care about it because we want to raise our children in safe communities. We care about it because we want people in our country who respect the rule of law, who don't violate our borders. We of course care about it because I know a lot of us know somebody who's been affected by this terrible drug epidemic. We want to give people second chances to get sober and to get clean. And that's not happening when Mexican drug cartels are bringing fentanyl into our country, killing our people. So, we care about the border for all the reasons that we discuss and there's a lot of them. But something the media just doesn't talk enough about is think about this. When you bring in, and I think the number is about 25 million illegal aliens that we have in the United States of America right at this minute, when you let 25 million people into this country, think about it. You got to house them somewhere. Most of them are living on the streets. We got American veterans living on the streets, but we've got illegal aliens living in first class hotels and American cities all across our country. But when you do that, you have American homes that are going to people who have no right to be here in the first place. And you know what that means? That means American citizens can't afford to own a slice of their own country. President Trump believes in this very simple principle, American homes for American citizens, not for people who have no legal rights to be in the United States of America. You know something else that happens when you let into many legal aliens, hospital wait times get really big. You know when I was growing up, that's often how we went to the doctor as maimol would take us to the emergency room. And you know what, emergency room wait times have skyrocketed in the last few years. So why are we allowing illegal aliens to come into our country and get healthcare that all by right go to American citizens? Why don't we take care of our own people and put American citizens first for a change? It's got to stop. The final thing I want to talk about with the border because it mean look you can talk about the border for the next half hour. But the other thing that is crazy about the border is in the state of Michigan, I didn't know the statistic until today. There are 85,000 students in Michigan public schools who are the children of illegal aliens. 85,000. Now think about that. Think about what it does to a poor school teacher who's just trying to get by with what they have is trying to educate their kids and then you drop in a few dozen kids into that school many of whom don't even speak English. Do you think that's good for the education of the American citizens? No it's not. So what really bothers me is when Kamala Harris talks about the southern border she talks about how we need to be compassionate to illegal aliens. And look I think we're a great country we can be compassionate and we ought to be compassionate but our compassion has to start with our fellow citizens, the people who deserve to be in the United States to begin with. And this is what I think is fundamentally different about Donald Trump's immigration policies versus Kamala Harris's wide open southern border. Is Donald Trump believes yes we can be compassionate but the best way to be compassionate is to enforce our border laws and take care of American citizens first. That is where the responsibility of America's leadership ought to be. So I want to talk about one other thing and then we'll take some questions from the press but we've got 28 or depending on how you count 27 days left in this election. That is not a whole lot of time. And I know that in states all across our country including in some of the battleground states people are already voting. You know people have already been sending me photos where they went out and voted for me and President Trump. That's obviously an incredible honor by the way to come from my family and to be sitting up here and to ask in all of you to make me your next Vice President of the United States. It's very humbling. It's an incredible honor. Thank you. Now y'all are way too kind. I appreciate it. But look what we look we're going to win this election. I really do believe we're going to win the state of Michigan. We're going to win this election but we're going to win this election not just to beat the Democrats as fun as that's going to be. I'm going to really enjoy beaten Kamala Harris. But we want to beat Kamala Harris because we want the American people to have a government that they deserve. A government that puts them first, a government that takes care of the American people's problems and not the problems of illegal aliens and people who don't deserve to be here. So let's just think about the contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. We talked about a legal immigration earlier. Well Kamala Harris has rolled out the red carpet to illegal aliens. He said we're going to give Medicare and Social Security benefits. That's the message that she has sent to people who want to cross the border illegally and come to this country. You know what Donald Trump's message is to illegal aliens? You got four months pack your bags because you're going home when Donald Trump is back in the White House. Kamala Harris's entire economic policy is to tax American citizens and to force them to buy things they don't even want to buy that are made overseas. That's terrible for American workers. That's terrible for American taxpayers. Donald Trump's plan is to cut taxes on American citizens, cut taxes on American workers, and penalize corporations that are shipping our jobs overseas. That is an America first economic plan. Donald Trump's basic energy policy is drill, baby drill, and it is a hell of an energy policy because look we have got the most boundful natural resources anywhere in the world. So why does Kamala Harris want to put American energy workers out of business and force us to buy energy from 10 pot dictators all over the world? Let's buy it from our own people from our own territory and that's how you build American prosperity. And that's actually by the way my friends another big difference between Donald Trump's policies and Kamala Harris's policies. You know when they ask Donald Trump what is your most important thing you can do to lower inflation? He actually gives a very simple but a very specific answer, drill baby drill because because energy goes into the cost of everything right? Think about it. If the truck drivers are paying more for gas then the groceries they deliver to the grocery store are going to get more expensive. If the truck drivers are paying more for diesel then they deliver lumber to a job site to build a house that means housing is going to get more expensive too. And of course we know ask any manufacturer one of their biggest costs is the cost of energy. So you lower the cost of energy, you create good jobs, you create great prosperity and you bring down the cost of goods for everyday American citizens. It is a win-win economic policy. It is the smartest and most important thing we can do. But Kamala Harris's economic policy, your herter state on the view today is to do exactly what Joe Biden did and it is going to lead to the exact same place. Higher inflation, fewer Americans with good jobs and a manufacturing sector that were shipped into China instead of building right here in the great city of Detroit. That is a lose-lose economic plan and I think we ought to have the win-win economic plan of Donald J. Trump. So before I take questions from the foreers I want to ask a very simple thing. Absentee voting has started in Michigan that means that you can request and return a ballot right now. And we got to do everything. We got to take care of every opportunity to vote that the state of Michigan is providing because look I talk to a lot of people, it is one of the things you do when you run for vice president. You talk to a lot of people and you know 95% of the people I meet will say I wanted to vote for Donald Trump in 2020 and I did. But then a few of them will tell me I wanted to vote for Donald Trump but I didn't because I planned to vote on election day but then my kid got sick and I had to pick go pick him up from school or I had a really late day at work and I didn't expect it and so by the time I got out of work you know working those overtime hours the polls were already closed. I gotta be honest with you I don't like the fact that we've gone from election day to election season in this country but it is what it is. And if the Democrats are going to take advantage of every avenue to vote then Republicans we've got to do it too so get out there make your voice heard and get out there and vote. There's a website I want you to take down and I ask you to do two things here. Number one take down this website swampthevoteusa.com swampthevoteusa.com. On that website you can check your registration you can check your polling location you can make sure your registration is up to date that is a very good resource for you to use. The other thing I want you to do is I want you to take out your phone and take a photo right now you can take it of you and your friends at this event you can take it of me up here in the podium this is making the secret service very nervous by the way so please move slowly my friends but here's the thing we're never going to have the power of the dishonest national media behind us but we do have people power we can talk about why we're voting for Donald Trump and we can do it in our capacity as citizens of this country so I'm sure you all have some social media or maybe just text whether you do email text put it on x.com put it on Facebook put it on Instagram just say why you're voting for Donald Trump for president because if every single person does that and a hundred people see what you put out there then that means thousands upon thousands of people are going to hear the truth about Donald J Trump and not the dishonesty from the media that is the biggest and best thing that we can do. So before we hit the road we'll take some questions from reporters I want to thank you all for being here thanks for having me I'll leave you with some final thoughts but it's such an honor to be here and to get this welcome in the motor city God bless you all thank you so much. All right all right so let me take let me take a few questions from reporters I'll answer them and then and then we'll have to hit the road but we got a microphone I sure we're passing around over there yeah go ahead great this is Claire and I'm with the Detroit Free Press we're in the city of Detroit today where we learned in a recent Jack Smith filing that the Trump campaign aid in 2020 allegedly urge supporters to riot at the ballot counting center so I want to make sure that the senator can hear my question which is would you discourage the campaign from engaging in that behavior and from Trump supporters engaging in chaotic scene so let me let me answer that question a few different ways so so first of all first of all of course we discourage rioting we do not riot nobody in this room and nobody in this movement is gonna riot second of all your question is about a Trump campaign staffer and I'll tell you that if you get a thousand people together and the Trump campaign probably has a lot more than a thousand campaign staffers you're gonna find somebody who's willing to say anything especially in a leaked a leaked message or private communication the idea that the Trump campaign either in 2020 or 2024 is encouraging people to riot is disgraceful of course we're not doing that and by the way and and by the way these fine people are law abiding citizens who work and pay their taxes they're not gonna riot no matter what anybody says to him and here's here's here's the final point I think it's interesting that the media is so focused on a random message from a random staffer in 2020 if you want to talk about rioting let's talk about the summer riots of 2020 that killed 20 people that the media seems uninterested in next next question hello my name is Sasha Calver I'm a reporter with the Michigan Daily so the University of Michigan all campuses have historically had some of the largest student voter turnout in the US why should students in Michigan cast their vote for the Trump fancied ticket and additionally how will your administration support students specifically concerning gun violence where you've rejected calls for tougher gun laws and bans on bumpstunks essentially why should students concerned about their safety on campus vote for you yes so the first the first let's be honest here I don't know I don't know if a Ohio State graduate is the best messenger to University of Michigan students so I hope and and and and back thank you sir you know maybe we should just get we should get a clip of me saying something nice about Kamala Harris out to University of Michigan because then maybe that all vote for Donald J Trump if you just told him I was a buck I like I you know I'm always a little nervous about injecting myself into the OSU Michigan rivalry here but I think that we all all kidding aside look we all care about the country and that's why I think every person in this room is going to help me make Donald J Trump the next president of the United States and it's in that spirit that I want to answer this question if I'm a if I'm a young person in Michigan here here's one thing that Donald Trump and I want to do first of all we want to make it easier for you to build a life and to have a good career and to have a good job in your home not to ship all the good jobs over to seize but to build a great middle class economy right here in the United States of America I think that's something that matters to a lot of Michigan students I think the second thing that matters to Michigan students is I don't want young people in this country to be permanently indebted because we built an economy that turns American citizens into poppers in their own country I want them to be able to own a home build some wealth for themselves and start a family right here in the state of Michigan and do it and do it because we've got smarter economic policies that are going to allow them to thrive Michigan students people who are meaning at the University of Michigan and all across the state because I know there's a lot of great universities in the state of Michigan we are turning an entire generation of American young people into folks who don't have enough money to own anything that is a terribly destructive direction for this country to go in Donald Trump and I want you to be able to own a slice of your own country and we're going to pursue economic policies that make that possible that's what we're going to fight for every single day and on and on the question about gun violence what I have said is that 90% upwards of 90% of the gun crime that's committed in this country is committed using an illegally obtained firearm so my point is making it unlawful to own that gun has not stopped 90% of these gun crimes so what we've got to do is take some common sense security measures and I think the best way to reduce gun crime in the United States of America I don't think this I think this is a statistical fact is to lock up people who are committing violence against their fellow citizens that's the most important thing and I you know I'm going to butcher the statistics so I don't want to give them exactly but if you look whether it's in Detroit or New York City any of our major cities and you look at the violence problem it is always a very very small number of people who commit the gross majority of violent crimes so why don't we get back in this country whether your whatever your racial background is whatever whether you're rich or poor get back to locking up that small number of violent criminals it'll make everybody safer everybody more secure and it'll actually give people public safety and I think that's the biggest way we can reduce violent crime in this country thank you next question senator vance can Coleman from michiganadvance.com uh Detroit is 77% African-American uh the state is 14% African-American why should African-American Michigan Anders vote for the Trump fans ticket. Well you know we've we've we've got we've got a great number of black Americans in this crowd right now they could probably answer that question better than I could but but but but but without calling everybody up here because I'm a politician I don't like to share the microphone with anybody as much as I like them what what I think they would agree with is number one Donald Trump wants to bring back public safety and an economy that brings prosperity for everybody good wages for good jobs that's the Trump promise and I think that's a great promise uh to black families in michigan and to everybody else here here's something else I mean there is this idea in the media and I don't know where it came from that somehow black Americans don't believe in public safety in this country well we know whether your Democrat Republican or independent black Americans do care about public safety in this country they want to empower our law enforcement officers to do their job of course do it respectfully and make sure we've got good relationships between police and community but we can have a good relationship between police and the communities they serve while we lock up the violent criminals and keep everybody safe in the process I think that's very possible and look I mean the the story of black Americans especially in a city of Detroit is actually very similar to the story of Appalachian white Americans who came from West Virginia Kentucky Tennessee we moved to places like Detroit black and white together because there were good jobs for people who were willing to work hard and play by the rules and it wasn't always perfect but for a generation in this country people black and white work together raise their families built things in this country and create a prosperity for the entire country and if you that that was the story by the way in the steel mill that my grandfather worked in for almost 40 years you had black folks and white folks living together working together and they they again it wasn't always perfect but it worked you know why it worked because we had good jobs for people who were willing to work hard and play by the rules the destruction of the manufacturing economy in the state of Michigan has been disastrous for black Americans and it's been disastrous for a lot of middle class white Americans too we can make things in this country again we can build things in the United States of America again and what we do is going to bring prosperity to black and white alike next question good afternoon Senator Bans my name is John E. Not from a Vante moda magazine and I'm a member of the local independent media here in Detroit so hopefully I'll get a little safer reception I'm a native Detroiter and I think Michiganders are really worried about a lot of things during this election cycle and I think a couple that I hear all the time is very nervous about their first amendment and their second amendment rights so the question is what will the Trump administration do to guarantee that people of Michigan that their rights will be protected and what's your view on those those amendments and then also to what extent should social media companies if any be able to moderate and control what people say online if it's legal yeah so let me let me try to answer that question as completely as I can number one I love the first and second amendments there's a reason their number one and number two is because they're the most important but you know you go back to the question gentleman asked earlier about black Americans and particularly what black Michiganders have to gain from a Trump presidency and if you look at the censorship and the vaccine mandates the idea that you should be fired from your job for speaking your mind that fell oftentimes hardest on black Americans as much as anybody else because it was often black Americans who are going on and saying well wait a second you know what why and again this is everybody but it was happening a lot in the black community why are we forced to take this shot in order to earn a living and provide bread for our children why are we being silenced by some of the biggest corporations in the United States of America I think that affects everybody but your answer about your question about technology companies the biggest threat to the first amendment in the United States of America is big technology companies who are trying to silence Americans for speaking their mind and the Trump campaign and the Trump presidency we've got no use for it and you guys about the second amendment look I believe we believe in the second amendment we believe that people ought to be able to keep their families and their children safe and it's that simple and I think there is a big difference between the Kamala Harris campaign Kamala Harris is explicitly endorsed gun confiscation Donald Trump has explicitly endorsed the second amendment of the U.S. Constitution I'd rather be on that side hi this is Jordan here with Nlive and Ann Arbor news you've talked a lot about like EVs and that kind of stuff today what would you say to voters who maybe agree with a lot of your policies but are concerned about climate change and environmental impact of the automotive ministry so here's what I'd say Sarah and I appreciate the question so first of all the most important thing that we can do to ensure clean air and clean water is to build more and make more stuff in the United States of America that is the biggest thing if look I would be lying to you if I told you that carbon emissions were was my number one issue okay it's not but if your number one issue is carbon emissions look at the two countries that have admitted the most carbon in the last 20 30 years it's China and it's India make more stuff in the United States of America that's how you make sure we have clean air and clean water and Kamala Harris policies have done the opposite the other thing I'd say to folks who are worried about the environment is is look I'm worried about the environment too but here's what I really worry about I worry about our food supply like what has gone wrong with our food supply that we have got an obesity epidemic in this country unlike we've ever seen in the history of the world that really worries me what are we putting you know we have all of these weird childhood diseases that we did not have three five third you know three decades ago five decades ago does that suggest that we're putting too much weird stuff in our water or too much weird stuff in our food supply you know what one of the people that I'm really proud has endorsed this campaign is Bobby Kennedy Jr. and I say that as and I say that as somebody who was raised by blue collar Democrats right the people who would have been Democrats in the 60s and 70s in this town those folks have been abandoned by Kamala Harris as Democratic Party but Bobby Kennedy has this slogan that is so true and has a lot of there's a lot of real depth built into it make America healthy again we I mean you you look at our young people we have skyrocketing rates of of mental health problems in the in the United States of America we use five times as much antidepressants as some of our peer countries in the world why are Americans five times as depressed as some of these other countries I think it suggests that we've got to do a better job at real environmental protection not the fake Kamala Harris environmental protection which apparently the only thing it means is ship all of our jobs to China let's make Americans healthy again let's make our water cleaner and our air cleaner and that's something Donald Trump but I believe in okay thank you senator historian with CBS news you said in an interview with newsmax yesterday that that uh FEMA was disaster relief was being used to uh fund migrate to focus on migrants rather Donald Trump also said on true social that most if not all of the money that FEMA spent is on migrants uh FEMA officials say that's just not true what evidence do you guys have to suggest that so here's here's here's here's the evidence and by the way I just want to make an observation about about these these these reporters and I appreciate the question is you know when when people say that they feel endangered by a crowd voicing their opinion well look my friends the first amendment goes in both directions and so you haven't made this criticism to be clear but but I I read some article it was in some I forget who published it but they were like well journalists don't feel safe and at some of our events look not a single person here is going to harm you they're just going to speak their mind and they have every right to do it so god bless you guys the first amendment we believe in it in this country but but sir my point is about the focus of our current administration and if you use resources but most importantly if you put people on the task of dealing let's say with a massive influx of illegal immigration then they're going to be distracted from doing their core job of keeping American safe in response to a disaster each of us this is true of me it's true of everybody in the world we only got so much time to focus and there's only so much time in the day and if you take FEMA and you turn it into an agency that resettles illegal immigrants that's going to take their focus away from keeping people safe after a hurricane that's basic human reality and I think there's no way around it now now what the fact checkers saying we'll sort of you know we'll try to be as fair to the other side as possible my friends what the fact checkers will say as well there's a bucket of money that goes to illegal immigrants and there's that's a different bucket of money that goes to disaster relief well I'm sure the Biden administration has never moved money from one bucket to the other and three and a half years and three and a half years we know that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are more than willing to move money from one bucket to another if it suits their purpose they ought to be moving money to the bucket that supports American citizens and the wake of these terrible storms that's what I would like them to do but the the final point I want to make about this is just bureaucratic focus look I've seen a lot of wild stuff out there on the internet the problem with what I've seen from the Biden administration is that they're not focused on getting resources to people that need it when Kamala Harris is out at his fundraiser in San Francisco meanwhile North Carolina is drowning North Carolinians have every right to say where the hell is our vice president and why is it she focused on us that focus is got to change the 82nd Airborne and this is in 2010 you're never going to hear me praise Barack Obama you rarely hear me praise Barack Obama but in 2010 there was a terrible earthquake in Port-Aprints Haiti a ton of people lost their lives a ton of people had their livelihoods destroyed the 82nd Airborne was in Port-Aprints Haiti under Barack Obama 48 hours later North Carolina is an hour away from the 82nd Airborne's headquarters why did it take a week to get the 82nd Airborne on the ground helping American citizens it's disgraceful go ahead ma'am and hello senator andre Ashilal with Reuters I have two questions for you one is sure but both of them are local so one of them is that senator Sanders was at a rally on Saturday and he talked about is this Bernie Bernie yes so I actually like Bernie he's kind of like a grumpy old man I like Bernie go ahead well so he brought up the comments that you've made where you've he said you declined to honor the commitment or to say if the Trump administration would honor the commitment to invest $500 million in the GM plant and to convert the Cadillac plant to EVs I wonder if you can just clear that up for us and then the other question has to do with the very large population of Arab and Muslim Americans here in the area and I'm wondering whether you're going to meet with them I know that several mayors for instance the mayor of him-traumat have endorsed your campaign but but just yesterday president Trump former president Trump said that he had been to Gaza later a campaign staffer said that he had been to Israel and Gaza is in Israel which is not true I wonder if you could just say a few words about Gaza and also why you think air of Americans and Muslims would would do better by voting for your campaign thanks well because let me answer the first question first so neither mean or president Trump has ever said that we want to take any money that's going to Michigan auto workers out of the state of Michigan we certainly want to invest in Michigan auto workers as much as possible what we've said is that Kamala Harris is offering table scraps $500 million when you have an EV mandate that's going to cost $117,000 auto worker jobs I think that Michigan auto workers deserve more than the table scraps at Kamala Harris's Green New Scam that's what we're talking about and and again you know you talk to auto makers you talk to the manufacturers they'll tell you that electric vehicles are sitting on the lots for 90 days for 120 days meanwhile the gas powered cars are sitting on the lots for 15 days or 20 days if you force Americans to buy electric vehicles they don't want that are made in China you are going to throw this entire state into poverty and Donald Trump and I will not stand for we're going to fight for these people we're going to fight for their jobs we're going to fight for their prosperity now the second question about Arab Americans I mean look we're thrilled to have the mayor's support and and I'm not meeting to your question I'm not meeting any Arab American or Muslim American leaders on this particular trip though we certainly will in future trips to Michigan you all are getting sick of me I'm going to be in Michigan like you know 30 times the next 28 days and to be clear for the fact checkers when I said I would be in Michigan 30 times that was a slight exaggeration that was something that was exaggeration used to affect it'll probably be like six or seven times over the next of the next 27 days but look I think I think the reason why and and this is one of these issues where obviously Arab Americans often have different views than Jewish Americans on what's going on in Israel what's going on in Palestine but I think both Jewish Americans and Arab Americans recognize that what's in the best interest of Israel and Palestine is peace and Donald J. Trump was the president of peace and I really think that's it you know I saw I saw I saw Kamala Harris said the other day that the biggest threat to the United States of America is Iran and look I think Iran's a big threat but Iran is nothing compared to China China is the biggest threat confronting this country but I think I think man it revealed that Kamala Harris seems to be totally fine with starting or escalating a conflict in every continent all over the world Donald Trump believes peace through strength stop the killing get Americans out of harm's way and focus on building a peaceful globe that is how you help Palestinians that's how you help Israelis but most importantly it's how you help American citizens is peace we'll do a couple more than we'll have to hit the road sir James Dixon New York Post when I was a kid Detroit was the king of manufacturing right in that time China and Mexico their rise has come on Detroit's decline how do you make Detroit build again what can you do from the White House so two big things first of all it goes back to President Trump's I think it's most simple but also his most specific public policy drill baby drill we what the big advantage the big advantage we have over China over Russia over any manufacturer is that we could have effectively free energy right here in the United States of America unleash American energy workers and we'll manufacture much more but here here's something and this is something that is a real real problem for Kamala Harris she attacks Donald Trump when Donald Trump says that he wants to impose tariffs to protect the jobs of American workers we'll think about this let's say for example that you want you want to manufacture in China and the wage in China because sometimes they're employing literal slaves in China actual slave laborers is three dollars a day so you can make a product in China paying somebody three dollars a day using a literal slave and then you bring that product into the United States of America that is the destruction of American manufacturing because Americans won't and most importantly American should not be expected to compete with Chinese slave laborers they deserve to have a good life in their own country and the only the only way to protect them from those Chinese companies using slave laborers is to say if you want to come back into the United States you're going to pay a big fat tariff before you do it that is an important part of our pro manufacturing policy and anybody anybody who tells you you can bring back American manufacturing without penalizing companies that are using slave laborers they are lying to you let's get real let's penalize the people using slave laborers let's reward the folks using American workers to build great products do one more question thank you senator I wanted to ask you about Bob Woodward's new reporting specifically about Trump and Putin's calls have you had conversations with the former president about his relationship with Putin and what those calls entailed I honestly didn't know that Bob Woodward was still alive until you just asked me that question that's what what little I know about Bob Woodward is that he is I'm going to use I'm going to use a word here he is a hack the guy's a hack so have I have I talked to Donald Trump about his calls with Vladimir Putin know I've never had that conversation with Donald Trump in my life but if Donald Trump even if it's true look is there something wrong with speaking to world leaders no is there anything wrong with engaging in diplomacy what Kamala Harris' approach has been to hide an abacement hide from the American people and hide from world leaders and you know what that's gotten us we're on the verge of world war three it's a disgrace and it's a complete failure of a foreign policy what what are my favorite Donald Trump moments of his first presidency you all you all may remember this but do you know Kim Jong-un he's you know he's the leader of North Korea and let's be honest Kim Jong-un hasn't skipped many meals okay so Donald Trump goes to Kim Jong-un and all you know he meets with them and all the photographers come in and and and President Trump looks at the photographers and he says all right everybody make us look good make us look very thin and and Kim Jong-un shoots up like this you know it's kind of kind of offended a little bit but what what it showed is Donald Trump's I'm not you know I see a lot of you laughing but I'm not just trying to make fun of Kim Jong-un the point is you have to go and talk to people you have to be willing to engage in diplomacy engage in conversations that's how you keep the world from falling into disarray and war and Donald Trump was better at it than anybody over the last 50 years we'll do we'll do we'll do one more we'll do one more here if we can I know I said I said that was the last one but this guy really wants to ask me a question it better be a good one man because you're thank you senator I represent Polish media dozecha conservative media Poland is the best ally America ever had in Europe it's a great no that that's right beautiful speech of Donald Trump in 2019 in Warsaw sir Kamala Harris claims that Polish American Catholics with vote for Harris world take it what is your message to Polish American Catholics and Catholics all together well she she said it better than I could my message is vote Trump and and make sure everybody in no vote Trump look Kamala Harris has been the biggest disaster for religious liberty in the history of this country Kamala Harris she wants to force Catholic nuns to engage in procedures that violate those Catholic nuns conscience Donald Trump and I think we're a big enough country to let Catholic nuns live their lives as they choose and to live out their values as fully as they want to Kamala Harris has tried to make it so that religious organizations can't do the things that they want to do Donald Trump and I love our churches and want to empower them to minister to people because we think that the best people to minister are those on the ground support in our fellow citizens and making their lives more blessed and easier and Donald Trump when he was president you know who Vladimir Putin was invading nobody nobody under the leadership of Donald Trump Vladimir Putin kept in his own country which is where we'd like to keep him under the policies of Kamala Harris Vladimir Putin seems to want to invade a lot of people and so if you're a Polish Catholic if you're a Polish American if you just care about common sense foreign policy and you want religious people to be able to live their faith Donald Trump is the only ticket in town vote Trump for religious freedom vote Trump for prosperity vote Trump for world peace so that that unfortunately is going to be the last question but let me leave you with one final thought you know I got to say to you other than other than and raising a family with this this beautiful person to my right here the greatest honor of my life is to be able to run for vice president of the United States it is the coolest thing you get to see this country in a totally different light I mean Michigan one of these reporters asked me earlier when we were doing a private conversation backstage she said every time you come to town the weather is good in Michigan and I guess my I guess my response is Michigan elect me vice president I'll come to town all the time that will keep Michigan weather looking pretty good but this is the most beautiful country anywhere in the world we have the best natural resources natural resources that the Russians the Chinese would literally kill for and on top of it we've got the most gracious and most generous people anywhere in the world I really do believe that I you know I I will meet people who tell me that they're struggling to buy groceries under Kamala Harris's economy but then they'll spend 30 seconds telling me about their life and then they'll spend three minutes telling me that they're praying for my family and asking me how I'm doing and what that teaches me what that teaches me is that we have a generosity of spirit in the United States of America that though we have bad leadership it is never going to destroy what makes this country great in the first place and that's our people that's all of you and I'm so grateful to you but what I do really worry is that this country is never going to be able to live to its full potential with the broken leadership of Kamala Harris groceries are never going to be affordable if we have the broken leadership of Kamala Harris we're not going to have peace in the in the world if we have the broken leadership of Kamala Harris so over the next 27 days what I'd ask you all to do is to do everything that you can to give the American people a president who is fit to lead and fit to serve this great country elect Donald J Trump let's go get it done let's do it together and let's take this country back God bless you all"
JD Vance shreds VP Harris for View appearance: A record to be ashamed of,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nkRkiUKu0k,2024-10-08 18:55:42+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win the 2024 US Presidential Election?,0.6025810241699219," be in the motor city. It's great to be in the state of Michigan. And I believe that it is in just 28 days where it has turned the state of Michigan red. Take back this country and make Donald Trump the next president of the United States. Now we are in one of the great capitals of American craftsmanship and American manufacturing. That's one of the things I love about the city of Detroit. This is one of the things I love about this community is for a generation, for many generations, the people in the state of Michigan, the people in the city of Detroit made great American products. They were proud of it and they had every single right to be. And I've already met some auto workers here today. I'm sure there are many auto workers in the audience with us right now. We're proud of you. We're grateful for you. And I promise you that when Donald Trump is back in the White House, auto workers in the city of Detroit are going to have an ally once again. Not somebody who's trying to destroy their jobs like Kamala Harris, but it's going to fight for their jobs every single day. Now I want to give a couple of shout outs here. I know we've got the great Congresswoman Lisa McLean. Lisa, thank you for being here. There we are, Lisa. Thank you. You guys have got a great Michigan GOP chair, Pete Hoax, sure. Where is Pete? Thank you, Pete. I think it was Pete who said all to me and said, I'm a little disappointed you only been in Michigan two times this week, not three times this week, Pete. We do what we can. And of course, the person I'm most thrilled to have here, no offense to anybody else, but as my lovely wife, Usha, we're so... It's a great honor and a lot of fun to be able to go around and campaign for Vice President with the most beautiful person in the world by your side, honey. I love you. Thank you for doing this. And I want to talk, because we are in a great capital of American craftsmanship. I want to talk about the fact that unfortunately we have got a leadership in this country that is trying to destroy the auto industry instead of building it. And let's just be honest about that. Under Kamala Harris, the American auto industry is suffering more than it has in at least 20 years. And I want to read off just a couple of statistics, especially for those folks who are watching at home. Here in Michigan, Stellantis announced it would permanently lay off 2,500, the Michigan auto workers, the folks who make the RAM 1500 classic, a great American automobile. Unfortunately, those Michigan auto workers lost their jobs. Last year, GM let go 1,300 workers at two Michigan plants. And we know that a lot of these companies are shipping manufacturing to Mexico and to China. Let's get back to the leadership of Donald Trump and make things in America and only in America. Now four, we see headlines consistently is rolling back a lot of its EV production. And we know that things that Kamala Harris's electric vehicle mandate 117,000 American auto jobs, a lot of them right here in Michigan are under threat. Well, here's something different. We're going to do when Donald J. Trump is president, instead of forcing Americans to buy electric vehicles, manufacturing in China, we're going to let Americans buy whatever the hell they want to because this is America. We believe in freedom. And we believe in letting people choose their own automobile. And of course, my friends, when they do pick the automobile that they want and that they choose, we know they're going to buy something made in the great state of Michigan. They're going to buy American because that's what so many Americans want. The best products. Now, I don't know if you all saw this, but I guess this morning Kamala Harris had an interview with the view. Wait a second. I am shocked that we don't have a whole lot of the view watchers here in the motor city. Sir, you don't watch Kamala Harris on the view? No. Well, I do the job sometimes that you folks don't want to. I actually watch Kamala Harris's interview on the view. Now, I'm going to tell you to go into the view as a Democrat politician. That's like the easiest interview in the entire world, right? I mean, if I walked into the view, that'd be like, well, that'd be like walking into this room with an Ohio State Jersey, right? That's something you just don't do. But she walks into the view and you would think that would be an interview and you know what they asked for? They gave her a softball and easy question. Really propaganda. They said, can you name a single thing where you disagree with Joe Biden? Now, let's back up for a second. Because remember, Kamala Harris's entire campaign is to pretend that she hasn't been the vice president for the last three and a half years. You know, she stands up before crowds and she'll say on day one, we're going to tackle the affordability crisis. On day one, we're going to secure the border and you listen to her for five minutes and you think, Kamala, are you going to vote for Donald Trump? Because you've been vice president for 14 hundred days. You haven't done anything. So you think after all this time, all this time of thinking about how she would do things differently from Joe Biden, she would have a well-prepared answer for the interviewers on the view. Will they ask her one thing you would do differently from Joe Biden? You know what she says? I can't really think of anything off the top of my head. Now, in her defense, I'm not sure she could think of anything off the top of her head, whether about Joe Biden's policies or anything else, but think about this for the last two months, Kamala Harris has been telling the American people that she's going to do things differently than Joe Biden, where she increased the cost of groceries by 25 percent. The average Michigan family has paid $1,000 more per month, that's $12,000 per year, to afford today what they could have afforded when Donald Trump was president. The border is wide open thanks to our illustrious borders are Kamala Harris, and her entire campaign has been to pretend that she doesn't bear any responsibility for the policies even though she's the sitting vice president. And here's the difference between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, there are so many of them, but the big difference is that Donald Trump has a record to be proud of, and Kamala Harris has her record to be ashamed of. You know, because when President Trump stands before a crowd, he doesn't try to pretend that he wasn't president, but she tries to pretend she wasn't the vice president. He doesn't pretend that he didn't have any decision-making authority over his own administration, because of course he did, but Kamala Harris runs from her own administration. And he know why Donald Trump isn't afraid to talk about his record. Well, number one, because he's actually honest with the American people, but most importantly, it's a record to be damn proud of, low inflation, rising take home pay, and a secure southern border. So for anybody watching at home, just ask yourself the very basic question, Kamala Harris has been in charge for four years. Are you better off than you were four years ago? And I think any honest person would say the answer is no, and you know who is certainly not better off than they were four years ago, Michigan auto workers. I mean, we just walk through thousands of job losses just in the state of Michigan because Kamala Harris would rather tax American citizens and force you to buy electric vehicles made in China. You know what Donald Trump wants to do? He wants to reward Michigan auto workers. He wants to give working people in this country a tax cut, and he wants to let Americans buy the cars that Americans want to buy. And we know when they do, they're going to buy a lot of Michigan-made automobiles. So let's just talk a little bit. We talked about manufacturing. We talked about automobiles. Let's talk about inflation. Because you know, the media they'll tell you, and this is one area where Kamala Harris, she can't quite figure out what she thinks. Because whenever they stick a microphone in front of her face, and that's rare, right? Kamala Harris very rarely does interviews, especially with hostile media, what she'll say, she'll actually brag about the fact that inflation is lower than it was when she took over. Now that's a bald face lie, and I ask anybody, think about the fact that Kamala Harris, anybody watching, think about the fact that Kamala Harris is bragging about inflation being lower. When you go to the grocery, does inflation feel like it's lower? Are American houses actually affordable for American citizens? Everywhere you look, prices are higher, things are more expensive, and American citizens can't afford the basic necessities. Look, I grew up in a family where my mammal sometimes struggled to buy the things that she needed. Sometimes she wouldn't buy prescription drugs so that she could afford to put food on our family table. I know what it's like when Washington leaders fail to do their job. And so Kamala Harris, instead of running a victory lap over your own policy failures, why don't you get it out there and talk to the American people and tell them how you're actually going to fix this terrible inflation problem caused by your policies. You know, gas prices are up 45 percent under Kamala Harris. That's just in Michigan. In Michigan, home prices are up 41 percent. I know we have a lot of parents and a lot of grandparents in this room. Speaking as the father of three young children, I would like my kids when they grow up and move out, and hopefully that eventually happens. But when they grow up and they move out, I want them to be able to afford home ownership in the United States of America. That's a core part of the American dream, right? And we know a lot of our young people right now cannot afford to own a home in the United States of America. Kamala Harris has failed to deliver the basic necessities of an economic prosperity for our citizens. And I think that we ought to say something very simple to Kamala Harris and Donald Trump is very fond of Sanit. You're fired. Go back to San Francisco, worry about long. We're getting the President of the American people to serve. I really worry, by the way, you know, we don't talk about this enough. I see we've got a lot of young people in this crowd. It's great. We've got some great generational diversity in this crowd. And I love that. I love that about our events. But it's a young people I want you to be able to own a slice of your own country. I want you to be able to build something, to build some wealth for yourself and for your family. You know, under Kamala Harris's policies, we've got credit card debt that is through the roof. We've got young people who can't afford to buy a home. We're creating a country where my generation, the millennial generation and everybody younger, they're going to be poppers in their own country. And I think that's a disgrace. I want the American dream to be affordable again. And it's only going to happen when we put Donald J. Trump back in the White House. My friends, I did not realize this. We are joined by a real celebrity, Brick Suitman, right here in the second row. And a way bigger celebrity than I am this guy. But you're going to talk about housing and the media, they don't like to talk about the fact that one of the biggest drivers of housing costs, one of the biggest reasons why our young people can't afford to buy a home is because under Kamala Harris's leadership, we have let in millions upon millions of people who don't have any right to be here. It's a big driver of housing costs. So, illegal immigration, we care about it for a whole host of reasons. We care about it because we want to raise our children in safe communities. We care about it because we want people in our country who respect the rule of law, who don't violate our borders. We of course care about it because I know a lot of us know somebody who's been affected by this terrible drug epidemic. We want to give people second chances to get sober and to get clean. And that's not happening when Mexican drug cartels are bringing fentanyl into our country, killing our people. So, we care about the border for all the reasons that we discuss and there's a lot of them. But something the media just doesn't talk enough about is think about this. When you bring in, and I think the number is about 25 million illegal aliens that we have in the United States of America right at this minute, when you let 25 million people into this country, think about it. You got to house them somewhere. Most of them are living on the streets. We got American veterans living on the streets, but we've got illegal aliens living in first class hotels and American cities all across our country. But when you do that, you have American homes that are going to people who have no right to be here in the first place. And you know what that means? That means American citizens can't afford to own a slice of their own country. President Trump believes in this very simple principle, American homes for American citizens, not for people who have no legal rights to be in the United States of America. You know something else that happens when you let into many legal aliens, hospital wait times get really big. You know when I was growing up, that's often how we went to the doctor as maimol would take us to the emergency room. And you know what, emergency room wait times have skyrocketed in the last few years. So why are we allowing illegal aliens to come into our country and get healthcare that all by right go to American citizens? Why don't we take care of our own people and put American citizens first for a change? It's got to stop. The final thing I want to talk about with the border because it mean look you can talk about the border for the next half hour. But the other thing that is crazy about the border is in the state of Michigan, I didn't know the statistic until today. There are 85,000 students in Michigan public schools who are the children of illegal aliens. 85,000. Now think about that. Think about what it does to a poor school teacher who's just trying to get by with what they have is trying to educate their kids and then you drop in a few dozen kids into that school many of whom don't even speak English. Do you think that's good for the education of the American citizens? No it's not. So what really bothers me is when Kamala Harris talks about the southern border she talks about how we need to be compassionate to illegal aliens. And look I think we're a great country we can be compassionate and we ought to be compassionate but our compassion has to start with our fellow citizens, the people who deserve to be in the United States to begin with. And this is what I think is fundamentally different about Donald Trump's immigration policies versus Kamala Harris's wide open southern border. Is Donald Trump believes yes we can be compassionate but the best way to be compassionate is to enforce our border laws and take care of American citizens first. That is where the responsibility of America's leadership ought to be. So I want to talk about one other thing and then we'll take some questions from the press but we've got 28 or depending on how you count 27 days left in this election. That is not a whole lot of time. And I know that in states all across our country including in some of the battleground states people are already voting. You know people have already been sending me photos where they went out and voted for me and President Trump. That's obviously an incredible honor by the way to come from my family and to be sitting up here and to ask in all of you to make me your next Vice President of the United States. It's very humbling. It's an incredible honor. Thank you. Now y'all are way too kind. I appreciate it. But look what we look we're going to win this election. I really do believe we're going to win the state of Michigan. We're going to win this election but we're going to win this election not just to beat the Democrats as fun as that's going to be. I'm going to really enjoy beaten Kamala Harris. But we want to beat Kamala Harris because we want the American people to have a government that they deserve. A government that puts them first, a government that takes care of the American people's problems and not the problems of illegal aliens and people who don't deserve to be here. So let's just think about the contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. We talked about a legal immigration earlier. Well Kamala Harris has rolled out the red carpet to illegal aliens. He said we're going to give Medicare and Social Security benefits. That's the message that she has sent to people who want to cross the border illegally and come to this country. You know what Donald Trump's message is to illegal aliens? You got four months pack your bags because you're going home when Donald Trump is back in the White House. Kamala Harris's entire economic policy is to tax American citizens and to force them to buy things they don't even want to buy that are made overseas. That's terrible for American workers. That's terrible for American taxpayers. Donald Trump's plan is to cut taxes on American citizens, cut taxes on American workers, and penalize corporations that are shipping our jobs overseas. That is an America first economic plan. Donald Trump's basic energy policy is drill, baby drill, and it is a hell of an energy policy because look we have got the most boundful natural resources anywhere in the world. So why does Kamala Harris want to put American energy workers out of business and force us to buy energy from 10 pot dictators all over the world? Let's buy it from our own people from our own territory and that's how you build American prosperity. And that's actually by the way my friends another big difference between Donald Trump's policies and Kamala Harris's policies. You know when they ask Donald Trump what is your most important thing you can do to lower inflation? He actually gives a very simple but a very specific answer, drill baby drill because because energy goes into the cost of everything right? Think about it. If the truck drivers are paying more for gas then the groceries they deliver to the grocery store are going to get more expensive. If the truck drivers are paying more for diesel then they deliver lumber to a job site to build a house that means housing is going to get more expensive too. And of course we know ask any manufacturer one of their biggest costs is the cost of energy. So you lower the cost of energy, you create good jobs, you create great prosperity and you bring down the cost of goods for everyday American citizens. It is a win-win economic policy. It is the smartest and most important thing we can do. But Kamala Harris's economic policy, your herter state on the view today is to do exactly what Joe Biden did and it is going to lead to the exact same place. Higher inflation, fewer Americans with good jobs and a manufacturing sector that were shipped into China instead of building right here in the great city of Detroit. That is a lose-lose economic plan and I think we ought to have the win-win economic plan of Donald J. Trump. So before I take questions from the foreers I want to ask a very simple thing. Absentee voting has started in Michigan that means that you can request and return a ballot right now. And we got to do everything. We got to take care of every opportunity to vote that the state of Michigan is providing because look I talk to a lot of people, it is one of the things you do when you run for vice president. You talk to a lot of people and you know 95% of the people I meet will say I wanted to vote for Donald Trump in 2020 and I did. But then a few of them will tell me I wanted to vote for Donald Trump but I didn't because I planned to vote on election day but then my kid got sick and I had to pick go pick him up from school or I had a really late day at work and I didn't expect it and so by the time I got out of work you know working those overtime hours the polls were already closed. I gotta be honest with you I don't like the fact that we've gone from election day to election season in this country but it is what it is. And if the Democrats are going to take advantage of every avenue to vote then Republicans we've got to do it too so get out there make your voice heard and get out there and vote. There's a website I want you to take down and I ask you to do two things here. Number one take down this website swampthevoteusa.com swampthevoteusa.com. On that website you can check your registration you can check your polling location you can make sure your registration is up to date that is a very good resource for you to use. The other thing I want you to do is I want you to take out your phone and take a photo right now you can take it of you and your friends at this event you can take it of me up here in the podium this is making the secret service very nervous by the way so please move slowly my friends but here's the thing we're never going to have the power of the dishonest national media behind us but we do have people power we can talk about why we're voting for Donald Trump and we can do it in our capacity as citizens of this country so I'm sure you all have some social media or maybe just text whether you do email text put it on x.com put it on Facebook put it on Instagram just say why you're voting for Donald Trump for president because if every single person does that and a hundred people see what you put out there then that means thousands upon thousands of people are going to hear the truth about Donald J Trump and not the dishonesty from the media that is the biggest and best thing that we can do. So before we hit the road we'll take some questions from reporters I want to thank you all for being here thanks for having me I'll leave you with some final thoughts but it's such an honor to be here and to get this welcome in the motor city God bless you all thank you so much. All right all right so let me take let me take a few questions from reporters I'll answer them and then and then we'll have to hit the road but we got a microphone I sure we're passing around over there yeah go ahead great this is Claire and I'm with the Detroit Free Press we're in the city of Detroit today where we learned in a recent Jack Smith filing that the Trump campaign aid in 2020 allegedly urge supporters to riot at the ballot counting center so I want to make sure that the senator can hear my question which is would you discourage the campaign from engaging in that behavior and from Trump supporters engaging in chaotic scene so let me let me answer that question a few different ways so so first of all first of all of course we discourage rioting we do not riot nobody in this room and nobody in this movement is gonna riot second of all your question is about a Trump campaign staffer and I'll tell you that if you get a thousand people together and the Trump campaign probably has a lot more than a thousand campaign staffers you're gonna find somebody who's willing to say anything especially in a leaked a leaked message or private communication the idea that the Trump campaign either in 2020 or 2024 is encouraging people to riot is disgraceful of course we're not doing that and by the way and and by the way these fine people are law abiding citizens who work and pay their taxes they're not gonna riot no matter what anybody says to him and here's here's here's the final point I think it's interesting that the media is so focused on a random message from a random staffer in 2020 if you want to talk about rioting let's talk about the summer riots of 2020 that killed 20 people that the media seems uninterested in next next question hello my name is Sasha Calver I'm a reporter with the Michigan Daily so the University of Michigan all campuses have historically had some of the largest student voter turnout in the US why should students in Michigan cast their vote for the Trump fancied ticket and additionally how will your administration support students specifically concerning gun violence where you've rejected calls for tougher gun laws and bans on bumpstunks essentially why should students concerned about their safety on campus vote for you yes so the first the first let's be honest here I don't know I don't know if a Ohio State graduate is the best messenger to University of Michigan students so I hope and and and and back thank you sir you know maybe we should just get we should get a clip of me saying something nice about Kamala Harris out to University of Michigan because then maybe that all vote for Donald J Trump if you just told him I was a buck I like I you know I'm always a little nervous about injecting myself into the OSU Michigan rivalry here but I think that we all all kidding aside look we all care about the country and that's why I think every person in this room is going to help me make Donald J Trump the next president of the United States and it's in that spirit that I want to answer this question if I'm a if I'm a young person in Michigan here here's one thing that Donald Trump and I want to do first of all we want to make it easier for you to build a life and to have a good career and to have a good job in your home not to ship all the good jobs over to seize but to build a great middle class economy right here in the United States of America I think that's something that matters to a lot of Michigan students I think the second thing that matters to Michigan students is I don't want young people in this country to be permanently indebted because we built an economy that turns American citizens into poppers in their own country I want them to be able to own a home build some wealth for themselves and start a family right here in the state of Michigan and do it and do it because we've got smarter economic policies that are going to allow them to thrive Michigan students people who are meaning at the University of Michigan and all across the state because I know there's a lot of great universities in the state of Michigan we are turning an entire generation of American young people into folks who don't have enough money to own anything that is a terribly destructive direction for this country to go in Donald Trump and I want you to be able to own a slice of your own country and we're going to pursue economic policies that make that possible that's what we're going to fight for every single day and on and on the question about gun violence what I have said is that 90% upwards of 90% of the gun crime that's committed in this country is committed using an illegally obtained firearm so my point is making it unlawful to own that gun has not stopped 90% of these gun crimes so what we've got to do is take some common sense security measures and I think the best way to reduce gun crime in the United States of America I don't think this I think this is a statistical fact is to lock up people who are committing violence against their fellow citizens that's the most important thing and I you know I'm going to butcher the statistics so I don't want to give them exactly but if you look whether it's in Detroit or New York City any of our major cities and you look at the violence problem it is always a very very small number of people who commit the gross majority of violent crimes so why don't we get back in this country whether your whatever your racial background is whatever whether you're rich or poor get back to locking up that small number of violent criminals it'll make everybody safer everybody more secure and it'll actually give people public safety and I think that's the biggest way we can reduce violent crime in this country thank you next question senator vance can Coleman from michiganadvance.com uh Detroit is 77% African-American uh the state is 14% African-American why should African-American Michigan Anders vote for the Trump fans ticket. Well you know we've we've we've got we've got a great number of black Americans in this crowd right now they could probably answer that question better than I could but but but but but without calling everybody up here because I'm a politician I don't like to share the microphone with anybody as much as I like them what what I think they would agree with is number one Donald Trump wants to bring back public safety and an economy that brings prosperity for everybody good wages for good jobs that's the Trump promise and I think that's a great promise uh to black families in michigan and to everybody else here here's something else I mean there is this idea in the media and I don't know where it came from that somehow black Americans don't believe in public safety in this country well we know whether your Democrat Republican or independent black Americans do care about public safety in this country they want to empower our law enforcement officers to do their job of course do it respectfully and make sure we've got good relationships between police and community but we can have a good relationship between police and the communities they serve while we lock up the violent criminals and keep everybody safe in the process I think that's very possible and look I mean the the story of black Americans especially in a city of Detroit is actually very similar to the story of Appalachian white Americans who came from West Virginia Kentucky Tennessee we moved to places like Detroit black and white together because there were good jobs for people who were willing to work hard and play by the rules and it wasn't always perfect but for a generation in this country people black and white work together raise their families built things in this country and create a prosperity for the entire country and if you that that was the story by the way in the steel mill that my grandfather worked in for almost 40 years you had black folks and white folks living together working together and they they again it wasn't always perfect but it worked you know why it worked because we had good jobs for people who were willing to work hard and play by the rules the destruction of the manufacturing economy in the state of Michigan has been disastrous for black Americans and it's been disastrous for a lot of middle class white Americans too we can make things in this country again we can build things in the United States of America again and what we do is going to bring prosperity to black and white alike next question good afternoon Senator Bans my name is John E. Not from a Vante moda magazine and I'm a member of the local independent media here in Detroit so hopefully I'll get a little safer reception I'm a native Detroiter and I think Michiganders are really worried about a lot of things during this election cycle and I think a couple that I hear all the time is very nervous about their first amendment and their second amendment rights so the question is what will the Trump administration do to guarantee that people of Michigan that their rights will be protected and what's your view on those those amendments and then also to what extent should social media companies if any be able to moderate and control what people say online if it's legal yeah so let me let me try to answer that question as completely as I can number one I love the first and second amendments there's a reason their number one and number two is because they're the most important but you know you go back to the question gentleman asked earlier about black Americans and particularly what black Michiganders have to gain from a Trump presidency and if you look at the censorship and the vaccine mandates the idea that you should be fired from your job for speaking your mind that fell oftentimes hardest on black Americans as much as anybody else because it was often black Americans who are going on and saying well wait a second you know what why and again this is everybody but it was happening a lot in the black community why are we forced to take this shot in order to earn a living and provide bread for our children why are we being silenced by some of the biggest corporations in the United States of America I think that affects everybody but your answer about your question about technology companies the biggest threat to the first amendment in the United States of America is big technology companies who are trying to silence Americans for speaking their mind and the Trump campaign and the Trump presidency we've got no use for it and you guys about the second amendment look I believe we believe in the second amendment we believe that people ought to be able to keep their families and their children safe and it's that simple and I think there is a big difference between the Kamala Harris campaign Kamala Harris is explicitly endorsed gun confiscation Donald Trump has explicitly endorsed the second amendment of the U.S. Constitution I'd rather be on that side hi this is Jordan here with Nlive and Ann Arbor news you've talked a lot about like EVs and that kind of stuff today what would you say to voters who maybe agree with a lot of your policies but are concerned about climate change and environmental impact of the automotive ministry so here's what I'd say Sarah and I appreciate the question so first of all the most important thing that we can do to ensure clean air and clean water is to build more and make more stuff in the United States of America that is the biggest thing if look I would be lying to you if I told you that carbon emissions were was my number one issue okay it's not but if your number one issue is carbon emissions look at the two countries that have admitted the most carbon in the last 20 30 years it's China and it's India make more stuff in the United States of America that's how you make sure we have clean air and clean water and Kamala Harris policies have done the opposite the other thing I'd say to folks who are worried about the environment is is look I'm worried about the environment too but here's what I really worry about I worry about our food supply like what has gone wrong with our food supply that we have got an obesity epidemic in this country unlike we've ever seen in the history of the world that really worries me what are we putting you know we have all of these weird childhood diseases that we did not have three five third you know three decades ago five decades ago does that suggest that we're putting too much weird stuff in our water or too much weird stuff in our food supply you know what one of the people that I'm really proud has endorsed this campaign is Bobby Kennedy Jr. and I say that as and I say that as somebody who was raised by blue collar Democrats right the people who would have been Democrats in the 60s and 70s in this town those folks have been abandoned by Kamala Harris as Democratic Party but Bobby Kennedy has this slogan that is so true and has a lot of there's a lot of real depth built into it make America healthy again we I mean you you look at our young people we have skyrocketing rates of of mental health problems in the in the United States of America we use five times as much antidepressants as some of our peer countries in the world why are Americans five times as depressed as some of these other countries I think it suggests that we've got to do a better job at real environmental protection not the fake Kamala Harris environmental protection which apparently the only thing it means is ship all of our jobs to China let's make Americans healthy again let's make our water cleaner and our air cleaner and that's something Donald Trump but I believe in okay thank you senator historian with CBS news you said in an interview with newsmax yesterday that that uh FEMA was disaster relief was being used to uh fund migrate to focus on migrants rather Donald Trump also said on true social that most if not all of the money that FEMA spent is on migrants uh FEMA officials say that's just not true what evidence do you guys have to suggest that so here's here's here's here's the evidence and by the way I just want to make an observation about about these these these reporters and I appreciate the question is you know when when people say that they feel endangered by a crowd voicing their opinion well look my friends the first amendment goes in both directions and so you haven't made this criticism to be clear but but I I read some article it was in some I forget who published it but they were like well journalists don't feel safe and at some of our events look not a single person here is going to harm you they're just going to speak their mind and they have every right to do it so god bless you guys the first amendment we believe in it in this country but but sir my point is about the focus of our current administration and if you use resources but most importantly if you put people on the task of dealing let's say with a massive influx of illegal immigration then they're going to be distracted from doing their core job of keeping American safe in response to a disaster each of us this is true of me it's true of everybody in the world we only got so much time to focus and there's only so much time in the day and if you take FEMA and you turn it into an agency that resettles illegal immigrants that's going to take their focus away from keeping people safe after a hurricane that's basic human reality and I think there's no way around it now now what the fact checkers saying we'll sort of you know we'll try to be as fair to the other side as possible my friends what the fact checkers will say as well there's a bucket of money that goes to illegal immigrants and there's that's a different bucket of money that goes to disaster relief well I'm sure the Biden administration has never moved money from one bucket to the other and three and a half years and three and a half years we know that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden are more than willing to move money from one bucket to another if it suits their purpose they ought to be moving money to the bucket that supports American citizens and the wake of these terrible storms that's what I would like them to do but the the final point I want to make about this is just bureaucratic focus look I've seen a lot of wild stuff out there on the internet the problem with what I've seen from the Biden administration is that they're not focused on getting resources to people that need it when Kamala Harris is out at his fundraiser in San Francisco meanwhile North Carolina is drowning North Carolinians have every right to say where the hell is our vice president and why is it she focused on us that focus is got to change the 82nd Airborne and this is in 2010 you're never going to hear me praise Barack Obama you rarely hear me praise Barack Obama but in 2010 there was a terrible earthquake in Port-Aprints Haiti a ton of people lost their lives a ton of people had their livelihoods destroyed the 82nd Airborne was in Port-Aprints Haiti under Barack Obama 48 hours later North Carolina is an hour away from the 82nd Airborne's headquarters why did it take a week to get the 82nd Airborne on the ground helping American citizens it's disgraceful go ahead ma'am and hello senator andre Ashilal with Reuters I have two questions for you one is sure but both of them are local so one of them is that senator Sanders was at a rally on Saturday and he talked about is this Bernie Bernie yes so I actually like Bernie he's kind of like a grumpy old man I like Bernie go ahead well so he brought up the comments that you've made where you've he said you declined to honor the commitment or to say if the Trump administration would honor the commitment to invest $500 million in the GM plant and to convert the Cadillac plant to EVs I wonder if you can just clear that up for us and then the other question has to do with the very large population of Arab and Muslim Americans here in the area and I'm wondering whether you're going to meet with them I know that several mayors for instance the mayor of him-traumat have endorsed your campaign but but just yesterday president Trump former president Trump said that he had been to Gaza later a campaign staffer said that he had been to Israel and Gaza is in Israel which is not true I wonder if you could just say a few words about Gaza and also why you think air of Americans and Muslims would would do better by voting for your campaign thanks well because let me answer the first question first so neither mean or president Trump has ever said that we want to take any money that's going to Michigan auto workers out of the state of Michigan we certainly want to invest in Michigan auto workers as much as possible what we've said is that Kamala Harris is offering table scraps $500 million when you have an EV mandate that's going to cost $117,000 auto worker jobs I think that Michigan auto workers deserve more than the table scraps at Kamala Harris's Green New Scam that's what we're talking about and and again you know you talk to auto makers you talk to the manufacturers they'll tell you that electric vehicles are sitting on the lots for 90 days for 120 days meanwhile the gas powered cars are sitting on the lots for 15 days or 20 days if you force Americans to buy electric vehicles they don't want that are made in China you are going to throw this entire state into poverty and Donald Trump and I will not stand for we're going to fight for these people we're going to fight for their jobs we're going to fight for their prosperity now the second question about Arab Americans I mean look we're thrilled to have the mayor's support and and I'm not meeting to your question I'm not meeting any Arab American or Muslim American leaders on this particular trip though we certainly will in future trips to Michigan you all are getting sick of me I'm going to be in Michigan like you know 30 times the next 28 days and to be clear for the fact checkers when I said I would be in Michigan 30 times that was a slight exaggeration that was something that was exaggeration used to affect it'll probably be like six or seven times over the next of the next 27 days but look I think I think the reason why and and this is one of these issues where obviously Arab Americans often have different views than Jewish Americans on what's going on in Israel what's going on in Palestine but I think both Jewish Americans and Arab Americans recognize that what's in the best interest of Israel and Palestine is peace and Donald J. Trump was the president of peace and I really think that's it you know I saw I saw I saw Kamala Harris said the other day that the biggest threat to the United States of America is Iran and look I think Iran's a big threat but Iran is nothing compared to China China is the biggest threat confronting this country but I think I think man it revealed that Kamala Harris seems to be totally fine with starting or escalating a conflict in every continent all over the world Donald Trump believes peace through strength stop the killing get Americans out of harm's way and focus on building a peaceful globe that is how you help Palestinians that's how you help Israelis but most importantly it's how you help American citizens is peace we'll do a couple more than we'll have to hit the road sir James Dixon New York Post when I was a kid Detroit was the king of manufacturing right in that time China and Mexico their rise has come on Detroit's decline how do you make Detroit build again what can you do from the White House so two big things first of all it goes back to President Trump's I think it's most simple but also his most specific public policy drill baby drill we what the big advantage the big advantage we have over China over Russia over any manufacturer is that we could have effectively free energy right here in the United States of America unleash American energy workers and we'll manufacture much more but here here's something and this is something that is a real real problem for Kamala Harris she attacks Donald Trump when Donald Trump says that he wants to impose tariffs to protect the jobs of American workers we'll think about this let's say for example that you want you want to manufacture in China and the wage in China because sometimes they're employing literal slaves in China actual slave laborers is three dollars a day so you can make a product in China paying somebody three dollars a day using a literal slave and then you bring that product into the United States of America that is the destruction of American manufacturing because Americans won't and most importantly American should not be expected to compete with Chinese slave laborers they deserve to have a good life in their own country and the only the only way to protect them from those Chinese companies using slave laborers is to say if you want to come back into the United States you're going to pay a big fat tariff before you do it that is an important part of our pro manufacturing policy and anybody anybody who tells you you can bring back American manufacturing without penalizing companies that are using slave laborers they are lying to you let's get real let's penalize the people using slave laborers let's reward the folks using American workers to build great products do one more question thank you senator I wanted to ask you about Bob Woodward's new reporting specifically about Trump and Putin's calls have you had conversations with the former president about his relationship with Putin and what those calls entailed I honestly didn't know that Bob Woodward was still alive until you just asked me that question that's what what little I know about Bob Woodward is that he is I'm going to use I'm going to use a word here he is a hack the guy's a hack so have I have I talked to Donald Trump about his calls with Vladimir Putin know I've never had that conversation with Donald Trump in my life but if Donald Trump even if it's true look is there something wrong with speaking to world leaders no is there anything wrong with engaging in diplomacy what Kamala Harris' approach has been to hide an abacement hide from the American people and hide from world leaders and you know what that's gotten us we're on the verge of world war three it's a disgrace and it's a complete failure of a foreign policy what what are my favorite Donald Trump moments of his first presidency you all you all may remember this but do you know Kim Jong-un he's you know he's the leader of North Korea and let's be honest Kim Jong-un hasn't skipped many meals okay so Donald Trump goes to Kim Jong-un and all you know he meets with them and all the photographers come in and and and President Trump looks at the photographers and he says all right everybody make us look good make us look very thin and and Kim Jong-un shoots up like this you know it's kind of kind of offended a little bit but what what it showed is Donald Trump's I'm not you know I see a lot of you laughing but I'm not just trying to make fun of Kim Jong-un the point is you have to go and talk to people you have to be willing to engage in diplomacy engage in conversations that's how you keep the world from falling into disarray and war and Donald Trump was better at it than anybody over the last 50 years we'll do we'll do we'll do one more we'll do one more here if we can I know I said I said that was the last one but this guy really wants to ask me a question it better be a good one man because you're thank you senator I represent Polish media dozecha conservative media Poland is the best ally America ever had in Europe it's a great no that that's right beautiful speech of Donald Trump in 2019 in Warsaw sir Kamala Harris claims that Polish American Catholics with vote for Harris world take it what is your message to Polish American Catholics and Catholics all together well she she said it better than I could my message is vote Trump and and make sure everybody in no vote Trump look Kamala Harris has been the biggest disaster for religious liberty in the history of this country Kamala Harris she wants to force Catholic nuns to engage in procedures that violate those Catholic nuns conscience Donald Trump and I think we're a big enough country to let Catholic nuns live their lives as they choose and to live out their values as fully as they want to Kamala Harris has tried to make it so that religious organizations can't do the things that they want to do Donald Trump and I love our churches and want to empower them to minister to people because we think that the best people to minister are those on the ground support in our fellow citizens and making their lives more blessed and easier and Donald Trump when he was president you know who Vladimir Putin was invading nobody nobody under the leadership of Donald Trump Vladimir Putin kept in his own country which is where we'd like to keep him under the policies of Kamala Harris Vladimir Putin seems to want to invade a lot of people and so if you're a Polish Catholic if you're a Polish American if you just care about common sense foreign policy and you want religious people to be able to live their faith Donald Trump is the only ticket in town vote Trump for religious freedom vote Trump for prosperity vote Trump for world peace so that that unfortunately is going to be the last question but let me leave you with one final thought you know I got to say to you other than other than and raising a family with this this beautiful person to my right here the greatest honor of my life is to be able to run for vice president of the United States it is the coolest thing you get to see this country in a totally different light I mean Michigan one of these reporters asked me earlier when we were doing a private conversation backstage she said every time you come to town the weather is good in Michigan and I guess my I guess my response is Michigan elect me vice president I'll come to town all the time that will keep Michigan weather looking pretty good but this is the most beautiful country anywhere in the world we have the best natural resources natural resources that the Russians the Chinese would literally kill for and on top of it we've got the most gracious and most generous people anywhere in the world I really do believe that I you know I I will meet people who tell me that they're struggling to buy groceries under Kamala Harris's economy but then they'll spend 30 seconds telling me about their life and then they'll spend three minutes telling me that they're praying for my family and asking me how I'm doing and what that teaches me what that teaches me is that we have a generosity of spirit in the United States of America that though we have bad leadership it is never going to destroy what makes this country great in the first place and that's our people that's all of you and I'm so grateful to you but what I do really worry is that this country is never going to be able to live to its full potential with the broken leadership of Kamala Harris groceries are never going to be affordable if we have the broken leadership of Kamala Harris we're not going to have peace in the in the world if we have the broken leadership of Kamala Harris so over the next 27 days what I'd ask you all to do is to do everything that you can to give the American people a president who is fit to lead and fit to serve this great country elect Donald J Trump let's go get it done let's do it together and let's take this country back God bless you all"
FEMA has a major bureaucracy problem: Tulsi Gabbard,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ee2TNZDxdS4,2024-10-08 16:45:00+00:00,Trump nominates Tulsi Gabbard to Cabinet?,0.6822798848152161," So for more on all this now, Trump transition team, co-chair, former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is here. Gonna play in a moment here, the director of FEMA was with Brett last night, but President Trump is well familiar with Florida. Is he doing something now before this storm hits? Let's start there. You know, President Trump is continuing to do what we've seen him do in the wake of Hurricane Helene, reaching out and trying to provide support directly for those who need it the most. It's heartbreaking, Bill and Dana, just to see those who are still trying to recover in the wake of Helene now there in Florida, recognizing that there is even bigger hurricane that's headed their way. I think one of the most inspiring things and hopeful things that's come in the wake of these disasters is how many of our fellow Americans are stepping up to help fill the gap in the federal government. And in some cases, the state government's failure to meet the needs of people in these communities. I was there in North Carolina a couple of days ago and really I can't put into words just the devastation and the sense of loss that people feel there where their vehicles, their homes, their small businesses, their jobs literally swept away and gone in an instant. I was asking a local mayor there of a town with a population of less than 500 people, what about insurance? And they said most people don't have flood insurance because this is not an area that's prone to flooding in their lifetimes. And yet here they said this is a 500-year flood that they experienced. I've been raising money through my nonprofit. We must protect, we're deploying supplies there to North Carolina, chainsaws, starlink setups, generators, fuel. And of course, we're gonna continue to be here for our fellow Americans in Florida as well. They need help now. And unfortunately, what I saw there in North Carolina was a reminder of what we experienced in Maui last year in the wake of those historic fires. FEMA was saying, we're here, we're on the ground, but what I saw in Hawaii was they were in the town, in the city, they were not out in the communities that needed their help the most. I heard the same from these residents of these very rural communities in North Carolina. They don't have FEMA knocking on their door. They don't have FEMA approving contracts to go and get people to bring the excavators to start clearing that debris to prevent another major disaster from happening. Should they get more rainfall coming through? The scale of this is just impossible to convey in words. The number one message that people shared with me and asked me to share with others was, please don't forget us. This is gonna be a long road ahead for all of them. And we've got to continue to stand with them, whether or not our government, the Harris Biden administration is doing their job or not. Chelsea, last night, the FEMA director was on special report with Brett Baer. Watch here. We have been on the ground since before Hurricane Haleen hit Florida and before it crossed over North Carolina. And what I would say is just because somebody doesn't see a person in the FEMA shirt, doesn't mean that we're not in the area. The entire federal family is there to support this response. We've been there. We will continue to be there as long as it's needed to make sure we're meeting everybody's needs. Do you think FEMA needs to be enlarged? I think FEMA needs to better use its resources and be able to cut through the bureaucratic red tape that gets in the way of delivering direct response to people there. They are not good stewards of our taxpayer dollars. We've seen that. I've seen that in disaster after disaster. You have FEMA literally keeping their employees and workers in the four seasons in five star hotels while people who have been impacted by these disasters are quite literally homeless or staying in tents or finding places to stay in shelters. This is a major problem with FEMA where they're saying, oh, well, we've got this covered. It's just simply not the case in my experience in so many of these disasters that I've seen that I've been on the ground for. They're not providing the support for the people who need it most. People are being rejected even when they are applying for the $750 of assistance that Vice President Harris announced there in Charlotte, North Carolina. The needs are far greater than FEMA is providing. They're focused too much on their bureaucracy and not actually focused on those who need it the most. I Ted but is from North Carolina. He was almost shown last night. This is how he characterizes the response thus far. This has been characterized by lack of speed, lack of coordination and misplace priorities all over. But when I talk to the boots on the ground, literally the boots on the ground today, 18th Airborne Corps, some out of Kentucky from the 101st, some out of Fort Liberty from 82nd, they were ready, like Senator Tillas said, they were ready day one. But again, there was a lot of bureaucratic hand-ringing at the top that didn't let these folks go to work. Your program we must protect has raised a lot of money. Well, over $300,000 so far. So we hope to get those numbers higher and we'll find out what happens next. Tawsi, thank you for your time. I'm Steve Deucey. I'm Brian Kilme. And I'm meansly Earhart.

Jesse Watters: Kamala Harris has been a ghost,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM_0rSDlf_8,2024-10-08 02:15:02+00:00,Will Kamala Harris win the 2024 US Presidential Election?,0.6174206733703613," It's getting spooky. Democrats haunted by the echoes of Hillary Clinton. That's from Politico. Kamala went from being the next Obama to being Hillary. They're worried she's running the same play at Safe Campaign, up to this point. She's had about the same number of events as Hillary, and crooked had pneumonia. Since the DNC, Kamala spent half of her time in DC, a third of it without any public appearances. Trump is everywhere, anxious stems wonder why Harris isn't. Kamala's been a ghost, and even Vegas is spooked. Trump's up by seven points in the betting markets. Look at that. And CNN is gearing up for a horror show. What happens if the polls are slightly off? Remember back in 2020, the polls underestimated Donald Trump. So what happens if we have a similar error across across those key battleground states? Well, if that happens again, look at this. Donald Trump carries all of these great like battleground states. He carries Nevada as well. Of course, he carries Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. And he gets to get this. 312 electoral votes. So the bottom line is that we have an error like we did four years ago. Donald Trump is going to win this election. Kamala Harris is going to lose. Joy turning into dread. Even Saturday night feels it. Watch. OK. OK. He's out there. He's doing this thing, whatever that may be. Come on. Just relax. You know, you haven't had a night off in three months. Do you want to watch something less stressful, like the Menendez Brothers show? I don't know. It's like, yeah, I kind of wish I had picked Josh right now. Oh, Josh Shapiro? No, Josh. Cabernet. Look, Tittle be fine. It's not like he's going to say something crazy. I'm going to come up friends with school shooters. Obama world doesn't find it funny. Remember Kamala was his idea. David Axelrod says Harris needs to step it up. It's only the most difficult oral exam in the planet for the most difficult job. So Obama's ordering Harris to do more interviews. And the last time a Democrat didn't listen to Obama, they got cood. So Harris began a media blitz this week. This is how 60 minutes went. Is that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening? Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. I don't know what she just said there. In 60 minutes, Tolder, she's not living in the real world. My plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class and you strengthen America's economy, small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy. But pardon me, Madam Vice President, the question was, how are you going to pay for it? Well, one of the things I'm going to make sure that the richest among us who can afford it pay their fair share in taxes. But we're dealing with the real world here. But the real world includes how are you going to get this to Congress? You know, when you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about. No one knows what she's talking about. There's Kamala even know what she's talking about. She was on the caller daddy podcast and she doesn't even understand her own plans. Another thing that I'm really focused on is small businesses and startups and giving startups a $50,000 tax deduction because right now it's $5,000 and you can't start up anything, any small business with $5,000. Does Kamala not know what a tax deduction is? She thinks she's giving small business startups 50 grand. She doesn't know the difference between a tax deduction and a handout. Kamala has also never heard of the draft. I want to pose this question more to you and the daddy gang. But one of the biggest conversations in this year's election revolves around a woman's body. I want to take a moment and can we try to think of any law that gives the government the power to make a decision? I know what you're going to ask about a man's body. No. No. Is there any law? No. No. It's no. Besides the draft, maybe Vax mandates, even Andrea Mitchell admits people are realizing she's a lightweight. I think they've got to double down on doing more interviews and serious interviews. He's got such a big problem with men. I think there's an under account of the Trump vote. I think there is misogynation in all of this. Black and white men. Big problem, but also the business world. They don't think she is serious. They don't think she's a heavyweight. Kamala is doing Colbert tomorrow, a guy who held a fundraiser for the Biden Harris campaign. Then she's doing the view. Another love fest. And then Howard Stern. The last Democrat nominee who went on Stern dropped out. These are all safe spaces that make her look like she's getting out there, but she's just hiding in plain sight. We're in two proxy wars. The border is wide open, prices in crime are high, and she's doing frivolous sit-downs with friends. NBC says most of these sit-downs are just for the vibes. But the vibes are scary. The Democrat party is being haunted by Hillary's ghost, and Kamala keeps seeing Biden's. Joe won't stop bigfooting her and bragging about how close they were. President Biden just keeps tying her to his administration. Yes, I can tell you that that was a surprise to the Harris campaign. They found out just a few minutes before the president would be doing that. A lot of Harris' aides did not find that to be helpful. They do not want Joe Biden to be popping up in that way. Also, don't love the idea of him reminding people of their strong connection. How dare the Biden-tied Harris to the Biden-Harris administration. Doesn't he know how unpopular they are? It's like Kamala inherited all of his money and now wants nothing to do with him. But Biden keeps haunting her from his grave. He's insisting on campaigning for in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And Harris came in and said, you know, Joe, you don't really have to do that. It's okay. And Biden says, no, no, it's my pleasure. And after I campaigned for you and remind everybody how you co-sign my agenda, I'm going to Africa. Joe Biden in Africa is going to attract a lot of attention. Biden's stumbling across the Serengeti. Maybe isn't the kind of thing the Harris campaign is looking forward to. Biden on an African safari while the southeast is under water drowning in hurricanes? No good. A month before the election, Harris is trying to erase herself from the Biden-Harris administration and completely change your media strategy. Now, ask any political professional if pulling a 180 in the final stretch is a good tactic. That's not what you do when you're ahead. That's what you do when you're down and you're scrambling for something that sticks. Click here to subscribe to the Fox News YouTube page to catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis.

But the real world includes how are you going to get this to Congress? You know, when you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about. No one knows what she's talking about. There's Kamala even know what she's talking about. She was on the caller daddy podcast and she doesn't even understand her own plans. Another thing that I'm really focused on is small businesses and startups and giving startups a $50,000 tax deduction because right now it's $5,000 and you can't start up anything, any small business with $5,000. Does Kamala not know what a tax deduction is? She thinks she's giving small business startups 50 grand. She doesn't know the difference between a tax deduction and a handout. Kamala has also never heard of the draft. I want to pose this question more to you and the daddy gang. But one of the biggest conversations in this year's election revolves around a woman's body. I want to take a moment and can we try to think of any law that gives the government the power to make a decision? I know what you're going to ask about a man's body. No. No. Is there any law? No. No. It's no. Besides the draft, maybe Vax mandates, even Andrea Mitchell admits people are realizing she's a lightweight. I think they've got to double down on doing more interviews and serious interviews. He's got such a big problem with men. I think there's an under account of the Trump vote. I think there is misogynation in all of this. Black and white men. Big problem, but also the business world. They don't think she is serious. They don't think she's a heavyweight. Kamala is doing Colbert tomorrow, a guy who held a fundraiser for the Biden Harris campaign. Then she's doing the view. Another love fest. And then Howard Stern. The last Democrat nominee who went on Stern dropped out. These are all safe spaces that make her look like she's getting out there, but she's just hiding in plain sight. We're in two proxy wars. The border is wide open, prices in crime are high, and she's doing frivolous sit-downs with friends. NBC says most of these sit-downs are just for the vibes. But the vibes are scary. The Democrat party is being haunted by Hillary's ghost, and Kamala keeps seeing Biden's. Joe won't stop bigfooting her and bragging about how close they were. President Biden just keeps tying her to his administration. Yes, I can tell you that that was a surprise to the Harris campaign. They found out just a few minutes before the president would be doing that. A lot of Harris' aides did not find that to be helpful. They do not want Joe Biden to be popping up in that way. Also, don't love the idea of him reminding people of their strong connection. How dare the Biden-tied Harris to the Biden-Harris administration. Doesn't he know how unpopular they are? It's like Kamala inherited all of his money and now wants nothing to do with him. But Biden keeps haunting her from his grave. He's insisting on campaigning for in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And Harris came in and said, you know, Joe, you don't really have to do that. It's okay. And Biden says, no, no, it's my pleasure. And after I campaigned for you and remind everybody how you co-sign my agenda, I'm going to Africa. Joe Biden in Africa is going to attract a lot of attention. Biden's stumbling across the Serengeti. Maybe isn't the kind of thing the Harris campaign is looking forward to. Biden on an African safari while the southeast is under water drowning in hurricanes? No good. A month before the election, Harris is trying to erase herself from the Biden-Harris administration and completely change your media strategy. Now, ask any political professional if pulling a 180 in the final stretch is a good tactic. That's not what you do when you're ahead. That's what you do when you're down and you're scrambling for something that sticks. Click here to subscribe to the Fox News YouTube page to catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis.

Jesse Watters: Kamala Harris has been a ghost,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM_0rSDlf_8,2024-10-08 02:15:02+00:00,Will George W. Bush endorse Kamala Harris?,0.6042962074279785," It's getting spooky. Democrats haunted by the echoes of Hillary Clinton. That's from Politico. Kamala went from being the next Obama to being Hillary. They're worried she's running the same play at Safe Campaign, up to this point. She's had about the same number of events as Hillary, and crooked had pneumonia. Since the DNC, Kamala spent half of her time in DC, a third of it without any public appearances. Trump is everywhere, anxious stems wonder why Harris isn't. Kamala's been a ghost, and even Vegas is spooked. Trump's up by seven points in the betting markets. Look at that. And CNN is gearing up for a horror show. What happens if the polls are slightly off? Remember back in 2020, the polls underestimated Donald Trump. So what happens if we have a similar error across across those key battleground states? Well, if that happens again, look at this. Donald Trump carries all of these great like battleground states. He carries Nevada as well. Of course, he carries Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. And he gets to get this. 312 electoral votes. So the bottom line is that we have an error like we did four years ago. Donald Trump is going to win this election. Kamala Harris is going to lose. Joy turning into dread. Even Saturday night feels it. Watch. OK. OK. He's out there. He's doing this thing, whatever that may be. Come on. Just relax. You know, you haven't had a night off in three months. Do you want to watch something less stressful, like the Menendez Brothers show? I don't know. It's like, yeah, I kind of wish I had picked Josh right now. Oh, Josh Shapiro? No, Josh. Cabernet. Look, Tittle be fine. It's not like he's going to say something crazy. I'm going to come up friends with school shooters. Obama world doesn't find it funny. Remember Kamala was his idea. David Axelrod says Harris needs to step it up. It's only the most difficult oral exam in the planet for the most difficult job. So Obama's ordering Harris to do more interviews. And the last time a Democrat didn't listen to Obama, they got cood. So Harris began a media blitz this week. This is how 60 minutes went. Is that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening? Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. I don't know what she just said there. In 60 minutes, Tolder, she's not living in the real world. My plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class and you strengthen America's economy, small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy. But pardon me, Madam Vice President, the question was, how are you going to pay for it? Well, one of the things I'm going to make sure that the richest among us who can afford it pay their fair share in taxes. But we're dealing with the real world here.

"Elon Musk is a big deal surrogate for Trump, Fetterman warns",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrGNpqlxScQ,2024-10-06 17:00:11+00:00,Israel military response against Iran in October?,0.6091024279594421," Now, the U.S. is stepping up to be beside them, but make no mistake. Israel does not trust the U.S. Israel does not trust Biden and Harris, because they haven't been there. Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley says Israel doesn't trust the current administration, as the Israeli government is now weighing its retaliatory response to Iran. Joining us now, Pennsylvania Democratic Senator John Fetter, a staunch defender of Israel. Welcome back to the show, sir. I look great to be back. I want to play a little bit more from Ambassador Haley and get your reaction. Here's a bit more of what she had to say. He lifted the sanctions on Iran. He allowed the money to flow. He basically continued to dictate to our allies what they couldn't do. I'm glad Israel did. I'm glad Israel went forward and said enough with Biden and Harris. We're going to protect ourselves because we can't count on them to help us do that. Senator, do you agree with the ambassador that Israel should move forward and disregard the advice of the Biden-Harris administration or no? I really don't have any regard for what she's saying. I'm not going to politicize what's about in Israel right now. For me, it's about following Israel. I've been very clear that my voice in that vote is going to follow Israel on that. Whatever they decide to do and respond to Iran, I'm going to support that because Israel will have a better idea of the intelligence and the circumstances on the ground. That's why I'm going to support and follow that. And I also want to celebrate what Israel has been able to do. They've demolished Hamas and now they have humiliated Hezbollah and they are now cowering. And Iran shot 200 missiles and they vaporized those. So Iran now has left exposed and humiliated and Israel has put them back on the ropes and I am going to support what they continue to do. Yeah, and we wait to see what their response will be. And we know that there are often very long time frames in the Middle East about responses and answering. We know there's tension between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu. There's been no secret of that. When asked whether Israel should strike Iran's nuclear facilities this week, President Biden said, quote, the answer is no. Well, an opinion piece in Wall Street Journal puts it this way. Even before he talks with Mr. Netanyahu, the president engages in public lobbying aimed at blocking a sovereign state and American ally from deciding on its own with the best response to a direct military attack on its territory is. Iran attacked Israel for the second time in six months, but Mr. Biden tells Iran's Ayatollah Ali Kamehni that the U.S. will help the regime protect its most prized and threatening military asset. Peace goes on to say that this administration has waived sanctions, has been easier on Iran than it should be. You're among those most everybody who admits Iran is the centerpiece problem of the Middle East. So what do you make about this back and forth with Biden and Netanyahu? Well, again, Iran is the problem. And now they've had their proxies destroyed by Israel, whether that's Hezbollah or Hamas, the Israel has already done that. And now what's left really is Iran. And I ran, they sent 200 missiles towards civilians. And again, they were vaporized and now too. Now Iran is now having to face what really do they have the kinds of influences they're going to continue to have. And now Israel has the opportunity to target whether that's going to be oil or they're nuclear now. And Iran now is back on the ropes. And they've been exposed as weak. And they've been scattered. All right, I want to ask about your state, a huge electoral prize. You're getting a lot of love, a lot of visits. You're doing campaigning as well. Everybody wants to win the Commonwealth. On Friday the president talked about the Great Jobs report. He wants to say the economy, which tests as the number one issue in Pennsylvania as it does across the rest of the country. He wants to point to that and the progress that is being made on the economy. But one of your colleagues had this to say on X on Friday. This is GOP Senator Marco Rubio. He uses another fake jobs report out from Biden-Harris government today. Sixteen of the last seventeen reports have been significantly revised downwards. After media helps them with their fake headlines. But all the fake numbers in the world aren't going to fool people dealing with the Biden-Harris economic disaster every day. Our last poll in Pennsylvania shows 71 percent of Pennsylvanians think that the economy is only fair or poor. So what's the argument there to your constituents about why they should choose the Harris-Waltz ticket? Oh well I'm a fan of my colleague from Florida. I was actually shocked that Trump didn't pick him over over events. And now let's talk about Pennsylvania. And it's going to be very competitive. And that's another fact that the American economy is the world's envy. And now 250,000 new jobs and inflation has been put in check. And things continue to get better and better on that. And it's going to be very, very close. In 2020 I put out a picture of the Butler rally from Trump. And Dallas said it's going to be very close in 2020. And then it was. And now back he was in Butler. And it's the same thing. And nothing has changed. You know, it was a big rally. And there was tens and tens of thousands of people. And must, uh, joined him and, uh, Gus Musk is a big deal, uh, as a surrogate as well too. And that's why I'm spending my time in small rooms all across Pennsylvania and red counties. I was in Beaver County yesterday. And later today when I get off with you, I'm going to hit the lackister. And I'm going to be going all across Pennsylvania. Because we're going to fight for every last vote. And Trump understands that Pennsylvania picks the president. Our side definitely knows this. And we've seen that happen both in 2016 and in 2020. And I'm going to be doing this in 2024. And whoever is watching this, please, you know, you should understand that it's not going to come down to, uh, uh, you know, burns on Twitter or on who said this or who did this. It's going to be a very stark choice. And it's going to be close. And I do. I happen to believe that Harris will prevail just like, uh, Joe Biden did in 2020. All right. Well, we all appreciate the opportunity to spend time in Pennsylvania. So we'll be doing that a lot more for the next 30 days, Senator. Thank you. I'm Steve Ducy. I'm Brian Killme.

"Iran could push Israel into an unexpected deal with an 'arab partner,' congresswoman says",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU,2024-10-06 15:00:26+00:00,Israel x Hamas ceasefire in 2024?,0.6455948352813721," Tomorrow marks one year since Hamas launched its assault against Israel, killing more than 1,000 and taking hundreds more hostages. Now one year later, the war shows no signs of slowing down, with Israel fighting a two-front war against Hamas in the south and Hezbollah in the north. Senate Armed Services Committee member in combat veteran Joni Ernst joins us now. Senator, thanks for being here. So how do we do two things at once? How do we support Israel? And it's in that country doing what it needs to do to defend its sovereign borders and its people, while also not drawing us into a larger conflict in the Middle East. How do we do that? Well, Pete, thank you so much. And this is extremely important, because I'm sitting here in Red Oak, Iowa. It's a beautiful day in the middle of harvest. Peace and serenity, and yet Israel is half a world away, being torn apart. What can we do? We can continue to support Israel. They have the drive and desire to go after Hezbollah to make sure that Hamas is decimated. They want to push back on Iran. And I think, again, it's extremely important that we continue to provide them the means to push back against these nefarious entities that exist throughout the Middle East that are backed by Iran. Stability is important. We can also use soft power. We know that during Trump's administration, the Abraham Accords provided that peace and stability in the Middle East. We can return to that once again, but we have to have American leadership, leadership that is willing to be involved, to broker peace deals. And that's exactly what President Trump did. He will do again as our next president. Do you think possibly this specter of conflict with Iran, with Israel, could actually push them further out into the periphery and Israel closer to a peace deal with Saudi Arabia? I mean, I – I mean, I – you never know how these things are ultimately going to play out. Peace would be what we want. Has Israel opened that door – excuse me – Iran with their aggression opened that door back up? Yes, Pete. And this is something that Saudi Arabia and Israel have been working on for a number of years. What we call the normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. And I was just recently in the Middle East my fourth trip since last October 7th and spoke directly to MBS. And he did state that it wasn't a matter of if this deal happens, but when it happens. Now the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, of course, wants to see peace. They want to see a solution in Israel. But they are determined to normalize those relations with Israel because once they do that, there will be greater security in that region. All of these Arab partners in the Middle East, those partners with Israel and the Abraham Accords, they all see Iran as the great threat to their prosperity. So they all want to come together. The Kingdom wants to be involved in this as well. And I think Iran has pushed them much, much closer to Israel. And we hope that they are successful in getting this deal done with the assistance of the United States of America. If you're sitting in Israel's position, Senator, do you think now is the time from their perspective? If you believe that an Iranian bomb is an existential threat to you, that religious fanatics with a nuclear weapon would threaten the very existence of Israel. If you are Israel right now, would you do more to preemptively strike nuclear capabilities or does that escalate in ways that they don't want? If I were sitting in a position of power in Israel, yes, it is something that I most certainly would consider. I do think it's important that Israel maintain its right to existence. I just promoted a resolution introduced in the United States Senate with the support of all of my Republican colleagues saying that Israel has the right to exist. Iran is a threat to their right to exist. The door has been thrown wide open by Iran with their backing of Hezbollah, Hamas, the Islamic Palestinian jihad. You see this, of course, with their direct attacks now, two direct attacks in this current administration, which has never, ever happened before in Israel's short lifespan. So we know that they need to be able to push back. Iran has given them plenty of opportunity now to do that. So whether it's striking their oil fields or most certainly going after their nuclear infrastructure, I believe they have every right to do that. And I do believe the United States should enable them, however we can and what means we can so that Israel will forever remain a nation in safety and security. Senator, real quick, I just want to bring it back home a little bit too. But with a connection to the region, we, at the top of this hour, showed two tweets that Kamala Harris put out yesterday. One with 157 million for Lebanon and 100 for a highway in North Carolina. How do you react to the frustration people have seeing all that money going overseas, but not enough to our folks here at home? Oh, Pete, I hear it every day here in Iowa as well. And I understand the need to secure our own nation. And so I do support other nations when they want to step up, secure their nations. But when we're sending so much humanitarian aid to other nations, they were not able to provide for the humanitarian needs of our own citizens. This is a big issue. Our taxpayers work very, very hard. We need to take care of America first. Absolutely. Senator John Earns, thank you for your time. Enjoy the harvest season. Beautiful. Thanks, Pete.

Senate Armed Services Committee member in combat veteran Joni Ernst joins us now. Senator, thanks for being here. So how do we do two things at once? How do we support Israel? And it's in that country doing what it needs to do to defend its sovereign borders and its people, while also not drawing us into a larger conflict in the Middle East. How do we do that? Well, Pete, thank you so much. And this is extremely important, because I'm sitting here in Red Oak, Iowa. It's a beautiful day in the middle of harvest. Peace and serenity, and yet Israel is half a world away, being torn apart. What can we do? We can continue to support Israel. They have the drive and desire to go after Hezbollah to make sure that Hamas is decimated. They want to push back on Iran. And I think, again, it's extremely important that we continue to provide them the means to push back against these nefarious entities that exist throughout the Middle East that are backed by Iran. Stability is important. We can also use soft power. We know that during Trump's administration, the Abraham Accords provided that peace and stability in the Middle East. We can return to that once again, but we have to have American leadership, leadership that is willing to be involved, to broker peace deals. And that's exactly what President Trump did. He will do again as our next president. Do you think possibly this specter of conflict with Iran, with Israel, could actually push them further out into the periphery and Israel closer to a peace deal with Saudi Arabia? I mean, I – I mean, I – you never know how these things are ultimately going to play out. Peace would be what we want. Has Israel opened that door – excuse me – Iran with their aggression opened that door back up? Yes, Pete. And this is something that Saudi Arabia and Israel have been working on for a number of years. What we call the normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. And I was just recently in the Middle East my fourth trip since last October 7th and spoke directly to MBS. And he did state that it wasn't a matter of if this deal happens, but when it happens. Now the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, of course, wants to see peace. They want to see a solution in Israel. But they are determined to normalize those relations with Israel because once they do that, there will be greater security in that region. All of these Arab partners in the Middle East, those partners with Israel and the Abraham Accords, they all see Iran as the great threat to their prosperity. So they all want to come together. The Kingdom wants to be involved in this as well. And I think Iran has pushed them much, much closer to Israel.

Democrats admit this could 'doom' Kamala Harris,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAkX_GeifEE,2024-10-04 19:45:04+00:00,Will Kamala Harris drop out of presidential race?,0.7177810072898865," Well, it's now been 75 days since President Biden exited the presidential race and Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in. And still, she has yet to hold a single formal news conference. Now a new report reveals that there is growing worry among Democrats that she's not doing enough to win this razor-tight election. NBC News out with this headline, Harris is playing it safe. Some Democrats worry that could doom her campaign. Some Democrats say Harris's campaign is, quote, trying to keep her away. While another lawmaker claims that it's been a, quote, mistake to shield her and running mate Tim Walsh from interviews. And Jill Biden's former press secretary describes Harris' approach as, quote, duck and cover. Kennedy, this is interesting because we're calling the beginning when we were told, if it's not broke, don't fix it. And that the reason that she was shielded is because, oh, hey, everything's fine. So let's keep it status quo. Are these leaks, are these sentiments set to urge a fire under her campaign? Do they think it'll work? I mean, they absolutely should. And Tim Walsh didn't do her any favors this week at the Vice Presidential debate. He looked nervous. He looked unprepared. And I think that was a metaphor for the entire campaign because, you know, we've always made fun of politicians for running a 90s playbook. Well, she's actually running the 2020 playbook. And they put a lid on Joe Biden at three in the afternoon. And obviously, you know, his term has been extremely carefully managed. And you had people like the Vice President and Kringion Pierre saying, no, he's got more energy than we do. He runs circles around us every single day. And they're trying to create this mythology around her. But the problem is, the problems are so serious. She has to answer for them. If she can't take questions from the press, then how is she supposed to be able to handle a hurricane and inflation and the Fed meeting and a jobs report? And World War III, all at the same time, if she cannot take a single, unscripted question. So she has not been tested. She has not answered. And I think there are a lot of reasons why Democrats and a post-mortem, if she loses, to look at this and go, wow, we certainly did a lot of things wrong. Totally. A few months ago, Professor, there was an article that was written that essentially said, as long as anything doesn't go wrong in the outside world, Harris is safe. The reality is, a lot's going wrong in the outside world. And most of it is under her watch and because of decisions she and Biden made. So to Kennedy's point, they can't afford to sit by silent because Americans need leadership and answers now. Now, think about all the crises again, as Kennedy said, that the presidency has to face. We've got war in the Middle East, this hurricane, the economy, the border, and why we elect a president. Again, is because we want to concentrate vast amount of authority and someone who can act quickly. If you're going to run for that great office with that responsibility and run a kind of Coke Zero campaign where there's no calories, there's no sugar, there's no nothing, right? There's just bubbly water. That's insulting to the American people. It assumes the American people don't care who they're voting for. They don't care about policies. But it's also insulting to the Constitution. Because the key point about having a presidency is that we, the people, can hold accountable someone who's responsible for what the government does. If you were a campaign, we take note positions, have no policies, how can we hold her accountable, how are we going to be able to judge her performance? Should she be president? I think that's an even deeper worry. It almost makes it seem to me that her presidency will be failed if she gets into office. Oh, yeah, it's failed before it even started. And ironically, you mentioned Harris, sort of what a slap in the face it was for Americans to have their vice president go to the border for the first time, simply because all of a sudden she's campaigning. And then to everyone's point, but here we have these really incredible, volatile and just emergent situations. We really need a vice president. We really need someone. So she doesn't know what to do with this point. And Biden doesn't know which storm just happened in the storm zone that he just left. Who's running the country? Amen. And is that group or those people, are they still going to be running the country if in when she gets back into office, not as VP, but as the top? Like that, those are some real concerns that we have to have happen now. Have to ask about. So I look at what people do. Trump and the governor of Georgia camp will be down in Georgia together. And we've reported they've had some tough moments during the political season there together. I talked about unity in the GOP right now. We're seeing it. You saw DeSantis on earlier with me. You're seeing it. And we're seeing it together. Those those Republican governors, those people are pulling together. JD Vance will be near the home of Lake and Riley. You were talking about the border. That's where he'll be today. Also in Georgia. Kamala Harris will be in Michigan. I think that's really all you got to say. Kaylee talked to us about the political ramifications about the impact. What does this mean do you predict for the election? Look, Democrats are in panic mode. The Kamala campaigns in trouble and they know it. It's a razor-thin race. This is why you see an NBC piece questioning her strategy. But it's not just this NBC piece. There's a lot more going on. Democrats are panicking because JD Vance trounced Tim Walls. Kirsten Walker over at NBC said she was lighting up with text messages of people saying they could not believe how good JD Vance was and those people were Democrats. Politico said that Democrats were alarmed by how Walt's performed. And then all of a sudden you have this new Politico piece come in about Walls and the Kamala campaign not knowing about all of his lies and mis-truths before they chose him. That is like a subterfuge from someone somewhere saying, hmm, even we are realizing we have problems here on the ticket. It's not us. The Kamala team look over at Tim Walls. Undergirding all of this is the fact that she has a 2.2 percent lead and real clear politics nationally. Biden had an 8.1 percent lead. He was basically four times in a better polling position than her. So they are bringing in Obama next month. We will see if it works. But Obama didn't save Hillary. I don't know if he can save Kamala. Next week. Kaley. All of the next month. Don't forget. The vice president said this week she was sleep deprived. She was suffering from horrible insomnia. Biden and now said he wasn't going to seek reelection. The worst day she had after the worst insomnia, that was the day she chose Tim Walls. When she had no judgment. It's like that again throwing them under the bar. We roll your face. Shapiro is the obvious pick. Thanks for not picking up. Wow. We'll hopefully they keep not taking our good advice. Hey, everyone.

And still, she has yet to hold a single formal news conference. Now a new report reveals that there is growing worry among Democrats that she's not doing enough to win this razor-tight election. NBC News out with this headline, Harris is playing it safe. Some Democrats worry that could doom her campaign. Some Democrats say Harris's campaign is, quote, trying to keep her away. While another lawmaker claims that it's been a, quote, mistake to shield her and running mate Tim Walsh from interviews. And Jill Biden's former press secretary describes Harris' approach as, quote, duck and cover. Kennedy, this is interesting because we're calling the beginning when we were told, if it's not broke, don't fix it. And that the reason that she was shielded is because, oh, hey, everything's fine. So let's keep it status quo. Are these leaks, are these sentiments set to urge a fire under her campaign? Do they think it'll work? I mean, they absolutely should. And Tim Walsh didn't do her any favors this week at the Vice Presidential debate. He looked nervous. He looked unprepared. And I think that was a metaphor for the entire campaign because, you know, we've always made fun of politicians for running a 90s playbook. Well, she's actually running the 2020 playbook. And they put a lid on Joe Biden at three in the afternoon. And obviously, you know, his term has been extremely carefully managed. And you had people like the Vice President and Kringion Pierre saying, no, he's got more energy than we do. He runs circles around us every single day. And they're trying to create this mythology around her. But the problem is, the problems are so serious. She has to answer for them. If she can't take questions from the press, then how is she supposed to be able to handle a hurricane and inflation and the Fed meeting and a jobs report? And World War III, all at the same time, if she cannot take a single, unscripted question. So she has not been tested. She has not answered. And I think there are a lot of reasons why Democrats and a post-mortem, if she loses, to look at this and go, wow, we certainly did a lot of things wrong. Totally. A few months ago, Professor, there was an article that was written that essentially said, as long as anything doesn't go wrong in the outside world, Harris is safe. The reality is, a lot's going wrong in the outside world. And most of it is under her watch and because of decisions she and Biden made. So to Kennedy's point, they can't afford to sit by silent because Americans need leadership and answers now. Now, think about all the crises again, as Kennedy said, that the presidency has to face. We've got war in the Middle East, this hurricane, the economy, the border, and why we elect a president. Again, is because we want to concentrate vast amount of authority and someone who can act quickly. If you're going to run for that great office with that responsibility and run a kind of Coke Zero campaign where there's no calories, there's no sugar, there's no nothing, right? There's just bubbly water. That's insulting to the American people. It assumes the American people don't care who they're voting for. They don't care about policies. But it's also insulting to the Constitution. Because the key point about having a presidency is that we, the people, can hold accountable someone who's responsible for what the government does. If you were a campaign, we take note positions, have no policies, how can we hold her accountable, how are we going to be able to judge her performance? Should she be president? I think that's an even deeper worry. It almost makes it seem to me that her presidency will be failed if she gets into office. Oh, yeah, it's failed before it even started. And ironically, you mentioned Harris, sort of what a slap in the face it was for Americans to have their vice president go to the border for the first time, simply because all of a sudden she's campaigning. And then to everyone's point, but here we have these really incredible, volatile and just emergent situations. We really need a vice president. We really need someone. So she doesn't know what to do with this point. And Biden doesn't know which storm just happened in the storm zone that he just left. Who's running the country? Amen. And is that group or those people, are they still going to be running the country if in when she gets back into office, not as VP, but as the top? Like that, those are some real concerns that we have to have happen now. Have to ask about. So I look at what people do. Trump and the governor of Georgia camp will be down in Georgia together. And we've reported they've had some tough moments during the political season there together. I talked about unity in the GOP right now. We're seeing it. You saw DeSantis on earlier with me. You're seeing it. And we're seeing it together. Those those Republican governors, those people are pulling together. JD Vance will be near the home of Lake and Riley. You were talking about the border. That's where he'll be today. Also in Georgia. Kamala Harris will be in Michigan. I think that's really all you got to say. Kaylee talked to us about the political ramifications about the impact. What does this mean do you predict for the election? Look, Democrats are in panic mode. The Kamala campaigns in trouble and they know it. It's a razor-thin race. This is why you see an NBC piece questioning her strategy. But it's not just this NBC piece. There's a lot more going on. Democrats are panicking because JD Vance trounced Tim Walls. Kirsten Walker over at NBC said she was lighting up with text messages of people saying they could not believe how good JD Vance was and those people were Democrats. Politico said that Democrats were alarmed by how Walt's performed. And then all of a sudden you have this new Politico piece come in about Walls and the Kamala campaign not knowing about all of his lies and mis-truths before they chose him. That is like a subterfuge from someone somewhere saying, hmm, even we are realizing we have problems here on the ticket. It's not us. The Kamala team look over at Tim Walls. Undergirding all of this is the fact that she has a 2.2 percent lead and real clear politics nationally. Biden had an 8.1 percent lead. He was basically four times in a better polling position than her. So they are bringing in Obama next month. We will see if it works. But Obama didn't save Hillary. I don't know if he can save Kamala. Next week. Kaley. All of the next month. Don't forget. The vice president said this week she was sleep deprived. She was suffering from horrible insomnia. Biden and now said he wasn't going to seek reelection. The worst day she had after the worst insomnia, that was the day she chose Tim Walls. When she had no judgment. It's like that again throwing them under the bar. We roll your face. Shapiro is the obvious pick. Thanks for not picking up. Wow. We'll hopefully they keep not taking our good advice. Hey, everyone.

Ingraham: Dems are 'freakin out' over Michigan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fruvd6ySWAU,2024-10-04 01:24:06+00:00,Will a candidate from another party win Michigan Presidential Election?,0.6170290112495422," All right, Democrats are freaking out about Michigan tonight. Now, they know that Kamala isn't resonating with voters there. She's not connecting. Because they see what all of us see. Kamala just doesn't kind of jive with the blue collar voters. She doesn't connect with the middle class. They see through her lame campaign of joy and all of her biographical, blow-viating. And now the Trump campaign is practically making Michigan at second home. We're going to be here. Look, we're going to be here every week, probably me or President Trump until the election. Because this is such an important part of our state. Years of Americans have watched as our country has been stripped of our jobs. Seen our, you've seen our companies being sold off to foreign countries all the time. With my plan for the American economy, this will stop immediately. And we will begin to take other countries' jobs and factories bringing businesses and trillions and trillions of dollars back to the United States of America. The Trump Republican Party is the party of the American worker. And it's also the party of common sense. And it always will be. Now, let's take a look at how Trump has done in Michigan historically. In 2016, he won the state by just 0.3%. OK, you see it there. Then in 2020, Democrats flipped it winning by less than 3%. OK, you see all the red and the blue liberal cities. And now polls show a razor-thin margin. It's anybody's race within the margin of error. And real clear politics has it close. And this is a Mitchell Research Communications poll, one point. Joining me now in Michigan is Congressman John James, who's been to events with both Trump and Vance. Just over the last few days. Congressman, great to see you. Tell me what areas in Michigan are probably the best now for the Trump campaign to target and that are flippable from the last election. Well, Laura, you are so smart to bring up 2016. Right now, right now, we cannot be complacent. Hillary Clinton was ahead in the polls in 16 until she wasn't, until President Trump recognized how important Michigan was and camped out in Michigan in the final days. And we responded by recognizing that the way the Obama administration was leading the country is exactly the way the Harris administration's been leading the country right into a ditch. Right now, people in Michigan are waking up to the failures of these woke and green new deal policies that are sending our jobs overseas, that are leaving our borders open, and they're literally giving Iran a nuke right now. President Trump understands how important Michigan is and he's focused on fixing America starting right here in the center of the electoral universe right here in Michigan. Well, Michigan also could be trouble with Muslim voters for Harris. Now, they make up 4% of the state population. Currently, Trump and Harris are tied in the 40s among that group. And it's a group that by and led by 24 points in 2020. Wow, that is wild. Congressman, if he's able to pull over some of the Arab-American voters, how big of an impact will that have in the final tally here? I'll tell you what, to your last question, the most critical area in this entire state in my opinion right now is McComb County. The 10th congressional district comprises Southern portion McComb County and Rochester and Rochester Hills. And not only are Democrats going after President Trump, but they're also coming after me. They've called me their crown jewel. They are propping up a has been who actually said that the automotive industry is a dying industry. That is disqualifying for anyone. So President Trump is building this coalition. He's starting in McComb County spreading through Michigan. Go to John James and might learn more. Thanks. All right, Congressman, thank you so much.

This feels really dirty: Compagno,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKdAQpyBdCY,2024-10-03 20:15:02+00:00,Trump election interference trial doesn't start before November?,0.6711755990982056," 33 days until Election Day, although almost all the country has some form of early voting that's going on right now, so millions of Americans are already in that process. And yet this happens. Right before an election, the judge and former President Trump's election interference case has unsealed a key filing from special counsel Jack Smith. That filing lays out Smith's case more detailed than the previous indictment, and alleges evidence he'll use in an eventual trial against Trump, which by the way he can't do because of an unwritten agreement 60 days out from an election, you wouldn't take somebody running and put them on trial. But apparently you could dump all sorts of information out there that Trump, no doubt, is going to have to fight. So it's going to feel like trial, including many private conversations between Donald Trump and his former aides. Trump says the entire situation is just another, quote, hit job from the Department of Justice. David Spunt is in Washington with the news. David. Hi, Harris. The 165-page filing paints a picture of a president desperate to hold onto power. But as you mentioned, the timing of this massive court filing about a month before the election does raise serious questions for Jack Smith. Now the filing is special counsel Smith's latest effort to convince a judge that Donald Trump, the former president, should go to trial on charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election. The summer earlier this year, Smith took several blows, Harris, to this high profile case. The biggest when the US Supreme Court ruled over the summer that presidents are largely immune from prosecution for official acts. Smith and his team retooled and re-ropped the original indictment. Now say that Trump has a private citizen tried to overturn the election. Smith uses the word private many times in this filing. Quote, although the defendant was the incumbent president during the charge conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one. Now, a lot of focus also on former Vice President Mike Pence. The filing focuses on the pressure campaign that Pence faced not to certify the election results on January 6, 2021. On page 142 of the court filing, this scene is described. Quote, upon receiving a phone call, alerting him that Pence had been taken to a secure location, person 15, someone unnamed, rushed into the dining room to inform then President Trump in hopes that the defendant would take action to ensure Pence's safety. Instead, after person 15 delivered the news, the defendant, meaning then President Trump looked at him and said only, quote, so what? Overall, Smith says Trump told Lie after Lie and knew they weren't true, adding that the defendant used these lies to inflame and motivate the large and angry crowd of his supporters to march to the Capitol in disrupt the certificate, the certification, excuse me, of the proceeding. But Trump spokesman Harris told Fox News yesterday, quote, this entire case is a partisan, unconstitutional witch hunt that should be dismissed entirely together with all of the remaining Democrat hoaxes. And that's from Stephen Chung, Harris. David Spont, thank you for teaming it up with all those details. Shannon Brehm. Please explain why Jack Smith got a second bite of the apple with the U.S. Supreme Court, because that is your expertise with that immunity filing or their decision and how we got to this point realistically, because it feels personal. Well, I would say this. I'm happy that what people are seeing here is we were told some in the media would say, when we got that immunity decision, it's sweeping, it's just a get out of jail free card for a president who claims this all happened when I was a president. This proves that's not what the court did. They said, is there's got to be an analysis they gave guidance. And now that's what Jack Smith is doing. He's working through this process. We all know there was not going to be another trial before the election. So I'm going to get there. And this is the closest thing, as you mentioned, to getting to that. So as he now goes back to Judge Chuck and the Trump team filed, they tried to stop her releasing or unceiling all of this 165 pages. Clearly, the Trump team lost. Judge Chuck can't thought, let's go ahead and get it out there. But they're working through that process of what were official acts, which will have immunity and which words. So we're seeing this play out in the way the Supreme Court intended. This was not a blanket get out of jail card. This was the process that's got to happen. But the timing is tough for the Trump campaign. Now I don't know if people who are supportive of president Trump, they're not going to be swayed by anything that they're hearing in this. I don't know who it does affect, but it is awfully close when we already have 20 plus states who are voting. Well, it does give liberal networks. And you could see this happening already last night. An opportunity not to talk about all the disasters that are unfolding on this watch. The headlight changer. The headlight changer. Harris administration and the Harris Walls campaign won't have to answer questions about it because Lord knows that would be confusing. But it gives them a way to then hone in on the one thing they think is a unifier on the left and that is hating Trump. I'm curious to know though, if people are really feeling bad right now, both economically and in other ways, those disasters are having a way between the port strike and so on. They're affecting more and more people from both sides of the aisle. I don't know how many people are going to be paying attention to the table read that Rachel Maddow will be doing. That's right. I noticed immediately the headlines and the coverage on all of those liberal networks yesterday changed immediately. From the Hurricane Helene devastation, from the coverage of the vice presidential debate and all of the facts and statistics and policies put forth by JD Vance in contrast to walls, all of that changed over to this. It feels dirty. It feels really dirty. And the fact that a factual proffer, by the way, that was what was unsealed. And when you dig into it, there are plenty of pages where, look, I'm saying this simply as an American, where a quote of, look, it doesn't matter if you win or lose, you've got a still fight like heck. Why is that considered evidence for something illegal? Isn't that evidence for something enthusiastic? Like, the amount of detail, David's might use the word desperate. That was a quote from Jack Smith. It is Jack Smith's portrayal as a desperate, private citizen. And that is what gets dumped on our laps on Americans laps during election voting season, the day after a disastrous debate for the Democrat Party. And we're supposed to think that's simply the wheels of justice turning. Absolutely not. Wow, I have to say I lawyer it up today. Does everybody on here has a legal delivery but me? Get yourself out of here. I'll just keep asking the good question. One of the most dangerous ones. I'll hit you on some firm. Some free advice here. I'll hit you on firm. So, you know, Jeremy, when you look at the timing of this though and you really want to adjudicate election interference, don't you have to not commit it when you go after pressing it against somebody else? That's exactly right. I mean, the case about election interference and then you do something that looks a lot like election interference, 33 days before the election, it's ridiculous. I mean, even for someone like, you know, a special council, I mean, he is someone who has, you know, had many years practicing law. This is kind of basic stuff. But even in law school, you have legal ethics class. Every law school has this. Even it, I don't have many positive things to say about Yale law school. I will say this. We did have a mandatory legal ethics class at least. And one of the things you learn is you don't want the appearance of looking biased, especially in a political season, political election right here. And even at the Department of Justice, there's a manual that says don't make a prosecutorial decision that will look like you're putting your thumb on the scale, you know, and right with election. But he had already technically done that. And he's doing that exactly right. So he wonders, why is he doing this? And then somebody on the left are hollering about, you know, our democracy and they're wondering why it's falling on deaf ears. It's because they do stuff like this. No one actually believes them. Cool. Yeah. Look, to your point, Emily, spot on. This is 34 days before an election just before Primetime News coverage. The day after a VP debate in which JD Vance outperformed every expectation to an extraordinary job. And then this comes. And again, very important point, you made this is a 165 page factual profford. That is Jack Smith's version of the case. In this country, we have innocence until proven guilty. We don't know what the other side's case is. Their brief is due October 17th. We have one version of the case floating around during early voting for two weeks and the judge here had full discretion. She didn't have to release this at all. She could have waited until after the election, but she dropped it now. It sure feels very political. It will not move the needle. I don't think people printed out 165 pages. Sad at their dinner table and read something by the way, which had very few new details. They were looking at the hurricane. They're looking at their pocketbooks. They're worried about the economy. That is what will frame this election. Yeah. I'm looking at the list since September 11th of absentee or early voting in most of the United States. I mean, it's two pages before I get to October 9th. So by the end of this week, that's almost the entire country of those places who offer that. A lot of people have already decided this election and need now to figure out how they pay for Christmas gifts and things that may not get there on time. What they're going to do for food that's spoiling in cargo containers right now, how expensive things are about to get all around. I mean, their eye is on the dollar. Yes. Exactly. Hey, everyone. I'm Emily Camponio. He and my co-host, Harris Balkner and Kayleigh McEnany, on outnumbered every weekday at 12 PM Eastern or sets your DVR.

This is bad news for Iran: Gen. Frank McKenzie,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaMRjR4scAg,2024-10-03 05:30:22+00:00,Will Israel target Tehran?,0.6458348035812378," Let's bring in retired four-star General Frank Mackenzie, the former commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, now executive director of the University of South Florida's Global and National Security Institute. And he is the author of the melting point. General Mackenzie, great to have you with us. Thank you so much for joining me today. I wonder what goes through your mind as you listen to Trey's report and you watch the events of the past couple of days, where Hasbola is under tremendous pressure. Iran is also under tremendous pressure having lost major leadership. And now we are at one of those perhaps tipping points in the Middle East. What is your take? Well, Martha, I think actually the people that are under the most stress are the Iranians. They've watched their principal ally, Lebanon's Isbola, B.D. Capitated. They've watched significant attrition of their military capabilities. And now the Israelis are methodically clearing north of the border so that there is really a way citizens can return to the northern tier of cabots, cities and villages in northern Israel. All of this is bad news for Iran. Last night they launched a major second major ballistic missile attack on Israel by any objective measure that attack too failed. So now Iran has really delivered a maximum effort against Israel. They can't count on Lebanese Hasbola to assist them in further attacks because of the decapitation and the ongoing Israeli military operations up there. So the people whose backs are really against the wall right now waiting for the Israeli response is Iranian senior leadership. They're not in a good place right now. All right. Two questions on that. The first one is about Hasbola. And what has happened to them? And were you surprised that they were able to launch over 200 missiles? And I think we're still learning about potential casualties in Israel, but an extraordinary situation where, I mean, isn't it humiliating to them that none of these missiles were the majority of them were not able to penetrate or to do any damage or significant damage? I think it's very humiliating to them. The crown jewels of Iran actually are ballistic missiles. It's drones and it's land attack cruise missiles. Now in the attack of last night, they chose not to use drones or land attack cruise missiles. My theory would be in order to gain surprise against Israel because of the 12 to 14-minute time of flight. However, we're able to discern when the Iranians begin to deploy their missiles. We know ahead of time. It's very difficult for Iran to gain surprise when they bring their missile force into the field. So we were able to respond. The Israelis did a very good job. We certainly assisted them. And I agree with you. I think that attack was largely ineffective and it's got to be profoundly embarrassing to the Iranians. But one last point I'd make, Martha, the Iranians have a boundless ability to lie to themselves within their own chain of command about how successful or unsuccessful their attacks are. So you don't know what we would want to know is how was that attack actually being reported to the Supreme Leader in Tehran? We might be surprised at what he's learning about it. Yeah, well, he's got to be a little nervous about his own future at this point because he watched the leader of Hamas be taken out in Tehran in a building there when he was at a ceremony and then Nasrallah. And he has to be wondering if his days are numbered as well. With regard to what President Biden has said about discouraging an Israeli attack on nuclear sites within Iran, I mean, that is the ultimate threat that faces Israel. And do they see this as a window that cannot be missed to mitigate that threat and to try to take out those sites, General? Well, Martha, I probably know as much about the Iranian nuclear program and the Iranian nuclear target as anybody in the world. It's a very large order to take out that program. If the Israelis wanted to do it, it would require vast expenditure of resources. It wouldn't be able to be done very quickly. It would be a long, it would be a long, hard slog. Can they do it? Possibly. I would think actually just speaking as a military observer, there are other more significant targets that you might want to undertake first as you calibrate your response to an attack against Israel that costs very few casualties and failed. And actually had the effect, as I've noted earlier, of pushing Iran further and further against the wall and into a very lonely core. So the nuclear program is certainly a target. There are other targets they could undertake. They might even choose to use restraint, although I would note that the restraint they used after the 13-April attack on Israel by Iran, Israeli fall back a couple of nights later with a very carefully sculpted, technologically impressive small attack, that didn't prevent the Iranians from coming back with the big attack of yesterday. So the Israelis have probably learned that lesson. So I suspect the Israeli response will be larger, probably much larger than what we saw in their response in April, as to who is going to go against all of the initiative. And I mean this absolutely, all of the initiative is with Israel right now. General McKenzie, you're a wealth of information and I've spent so much time in the region, and we're going to have you on speed dial, I think, over the next several weeks. So appreciate you spending time with us, sir."

Frank McKenzie,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaMRjR4scAg,2024-10-03 05:30:22+00:00,Will Israel target an Iranian nuclear facility?,0.6198321580886841," Let's bring in retired four-star General Frank Mackenzie, the former commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, now executive director of the University of South Florida's Global and National Security Institute. And he is the author of the melting point. General Mackenzie, great to have you with us. Thank you so much for joining me today. I wonder what goes through your mind as you listen to Trey's report and you watch the events of the past couple of days, where Hasbola is under tremendous pressure. Iran is also under tremendous pressure having lost major leadership. And now we are at one of those perhaps tipping points in the Middle East. What is your take? Well, Martha, I think actually the people that are under the most stress are the Iranians. They've watched their principal ally, Lebanon's Isbola, B.D. Capitated. They've watched significant attrition of their military capabilities. And now the Israelis are methodically clearing north of the border so that there is really a way citizens can return to the northern tier of cabots, cities and villages in northern Israel. All of this is bad news for Iran. Last night they launched a major second major ballistic missile attack on Israel by any objective measure that attack too failed. So now Iran has really delivered a maximum effort against Israel. They can't count on Lebanese Hasbola to assist them in further attacks because of the decapitation and the ongoing Israeli military operations up there. So the people whose backs are really against the wall right now waiting for the Israeli response is Iranian senior leadership. They're not in a good place right now. All right. Two questions on that. The first one is about Hasbola. And what has happened to them? And were you surprised that they were able to launch over 200 missiles? And I think we're still learning about potential casualties in Israel, but an extraordinary situation where, I mean, isn't it humiliating to them that none of these missiles were the majority of them were not able to penetrate or to do any damage or significant damage? I think it's very humiliating to them. The crown jewels of Iran actually are ballistic missiles. It's drones and it's land attack cruise missiles. Now in the attack of last night, they chose not to use drones or land attack cruise missiles. My theory would be in order to gain surprise against Israel because of the 12 to 14-minute time of flight. However, we're able to discern when the Iranians begin to deploy their missiles. We know ahead of time. It's very difficult for Iran to gain surprise when they bring their missile force into the field. So we were able to respond. The Israelis did a very good job. We certainly assisted them. And I agree with you. I think that attack was largely ineffective and it's got to be profoundly embarrassing to the Iranians. But one last point I'd make, Martha, the Iranians have a boundless ability to lie to themselves within their own chain of command about how successful or unsuccessful their attacks are. So you don't know what we would want to know is how was that attack actually being reported to the Supreme Leader in Tehran? We might be surprised at what he's learning about it. Yeah, well, he's got to be a little nervous about his own future at this point because he watched the leader of Hamas be taken out in Tehran in a building there when he was at a ceremony and then Nasrallah. And he has to be wondering if his days are numbered as well. With regard to what President Biden has said about discouraging an Israeli attack on nuclear sites within Iran, I mean, that is the ultimate threat that faces Israel. And do they see this as a window that cannot be missed to mitigate that threat and to try to take out those sites, General? Well, Martha, I probably know as much about the Iranian nuclear program and the Iranian nuclear target as anybody in the world. It's a very large order to take out that program. If the Israelis wanted to do it, it would require vast expenditure of resources. It wouldn't be able to be done very quickly. It would be a long, it would be a long, hard slog. Can they do it? Possibly. I would think actually just speaking as a military observer, there are other more significant targets that you might want to undertake first as you calibrate your response to an attack against Israel that costs very few casualties and failed. And actually had the effect, as I've noted earlier, of pushing Iran further and further against the wall and into a very lonely core. So the nuclear program is certainly a target. There are other targets they could undertake. They might even choose to use restraint, although I would note that the restraint they used after the 13-April attack on Israel by Iran, Israeli fall back a couple of nights later with a very carefully sculpted, technologically impressive small attack, that didn't prevent the Iranians from coming back with the big attack of yesterday. So the Israelis have probably learned that lesson. So I suspect the Israeli response will be larger, probably much larger than what we saw in their response in April, as to who is going to go against all of the initiative. And I mean this absolutely, all of the initiative is with Israel right now. General McKenzie, you're a wealth of information and I've spent so much time in the region, and we're going to have you on speed dial, I think, over the next several weeks. So appreciate you spending time with us, sir."

'The Five' reacts to the JD Vance-Tim Walz debate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USrK2XRoKr4,2024-10-02 21:45:02+00:00,Kamala Harris and JD Vance debate before election?,0.6097168922424316," Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino, along with Judge Jeanine Piro, Harold Bourd, Jr. Desi Waters, and Greg Gutfeldt. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is the 5. So the Democrats, Assistant Coach, fumbling the ball at the big VP debate Senator J.D. Vance and Governor Tim Walls striking a more civil tone as they tangled over the big issue space in the country. And it turns out, shielding your candidate from media scrutiny, just not the best strategy. Tim Walls only doing a half dozen interviews before the showdown, and it left him a little bit rusty when compared to the battle-tested Vance. A nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment. Governor Walls just accused Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos. Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence. People were afraid of stepping out of line. When we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, Donald Trump's fickle leadership. Donald Trump is fickle. If you blame Donald Trump, who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years, and the answer is you're running me, not mine. I set that office with those Sandiook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. You can't yell fire in a crowded theater. That's the test. That's the Supreme Court test. Tim, fire in a crowded theater. You guys wanted to kick people off of Facebook for saying that Toddler should- Senator Governor, Walls has face credibility issues from stolen baller claims who embellishing his military record. And last night, he stumbled over whether he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protest, despite many outlets reporting that he wasn't. Can you explain that discrepancy? My community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. They look, I will be the first to tell you, I have poured my heart into my community. I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect, and I'm a knucklehead at times. Governor, just to follow up on that, the question was, can you explain the discrepancy? No, just- All I said on this was is I got there that summer and mispoke on this. So I will just- That's what I've said. So I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protest. Governor Walls had an entire night to sleep on those comments, his clean up job wasn't that great. Look, I have my dates wrong. I was in Hong Kong and China in 1989. That- That move from Hong Kong into China, it was profound for me. That was the summer of democracy. I said it's where I understood how sacred democracy was. All right, Greg Gutfeld, haven't heard from you yet, and looking forward to it. He was unprepared, but why is that his fault? Democrats don't have to be prepared. They're usually operating under the assumption that it's going to be an easier ride for them, than if you were a Republican and he's like, what's up? What's with all this stuff? The media tried to lower expectations for Walls, and they were right to do that. Now that we see how he did. But they overplayed Vance's unlikeability. So you were expecting something that wasn't charming, smart, or steady. So the media actually helped Vance by amplifying his unlikeability. The first time you saw Vance was last night after a steady diet of media caricatures. What a shock it must have been. He's not weird. He's not mean. I mean, this guy came out and just shows you how the media lies to you. The media portrays those outside their bubble falsely. And then when you finally see the reality, then your eyes are open to the things they say, Vance, also did something good. He knew this wasn't a political talk show, where he's tried to score points by making statements loudly that will end up being retweeted. He wasn't going for the dopamine. He was going for the depth. And that was his mission, and his mission showed a contrast between steady and unsteady. He showed that a silencer is just as deadly as a shotgun. I think what is really cowardly though, is the mistake Democrats made by not choosing Shapiro. They might lose Pennsylvania. They definitely lost that debate because they wanted a guy who wasn't a Jew. And now you've got a non-Jew, whose frantic, nervous, chaotic liar. I think this was a real slap in the face of the Harris campaign, no offense to her husband. Judge, I want to get to you after you watch this. This is the liberal media who was forced to praise JD Vance, call for number four. Walls did seem unsteady. And frankly, what I saw in Walls is somebody who has not faced questions on a national stage since he became the Democratic nominee. In contrast, JD Vance was very smooth. I was getting texts from Democrats panicked quite frankly, who were saying, wow, he's really moderating himself on a lot of these issues. He's the most likable he has ever been. He seemed at many moments to be reasonable. Walls did not seem prepared for it. A lot about this debate tonight was weird. There were uncomfortable, cringy moments. There were so many niceties on that debate stage tonight. I am just kind of like, well, if you agree so much with JD Vance, why should they vote for you? All right, Judge, take it away. Well, I got to tell you, I mean, it's clear that even they understood that JD Vance was solid. He was friendly. He was polite. He was disciplined. And he was kind of guided for the first time. And by the way, 88% of the American people said that this was a debate that was civil and that they enjoyed. I mean, that's a wonderful thing. And that's because of JD Vance. When they tried to kind of move, we'll talk about that later. Or when Walls lied, he was polite. This is a guy who's going to reach across the aisle. This is a guy who will make not only a great vice president, but a great president one day. And I don't want to get into a lot of the small stuff. But I got to tell you, I was exhausted watching Walls. I mean, it was like this, that. I punched out, turn around, right down. It was almost like he was waiting for the fence to come in and arrest him or something. I was like exhausted. But JD Vance, he's so impressed me. And I think he impressed everybody. This is a guy who's going to try to solve problems. He didn't fight. He didn't play dirty. I just want to say one more thing about Walls. You know, being a knucklehead doesn't excuse you from being a serial liar. And I was saying, Harold, that Eddie Haskell from Leave It To Beaver was a knucklehead. Right? But, you know, lying about things that are pretty basic and they're not having the ability to land an answer. Your most important moment showed, I think, why the Democrats were nervous last night. How do you feel today? So good to be back with everybody. I think the analysis that's been around the table, I think it was a very civil debate. And I think Tim Walls contributed to the civility also. But I think that the round robin we did with the, some of the other reporters and journalists, who I thought were honest about, it's three of us were on last night. And I said, there are five things that I think you have to do when you are in a debate like this, President or Vice President. You got to be likable and optimistic. You got to show strength and capability. You got to be smart. You got to be relatable. And ultimately, you got to show that you're presidential. JD Vance, you're right, Judge. He was coming from a little bit of a deficit because of some of the media characterizations as you said, Greg. And he, you know, you walked away. I didn't agree with him on a lot of things, but I didn't think it was a bad guy. I just think it's a guy that I don't just, that I don't agree with on things. But in terms of a person, a father, someone who's decent, and he and they get greed on childcare. They agree on guns. They agree to even, in some areas, some other areas involving foreign policy. But they disagreed on some other things. I thought on the substance. JD was good on immigration and a border. He was good on the economy. He has serious questions about why is the device president doing this now? And I thought that after they took the first commercial break, Walls was good coming back as he got, he got, got a stride on abortion. He talked about health care and if we undo the affordable care, what happens? I thought JD didn't have, that was the only time his substantive answers. They weren't as smooth as some of the others. And finally, I think the question he asked about, will you accept the outcome of the election? Do you believe that President Trump does? And he didn't answer, didn't answer that. But you gotta, as you think, look at this thing overall, then you gotta say that he got the better of it. That being Senator Vance. Did you wear a tie like this for a special occasion? Is this a special occasion? I mean, it feels, it feels like happy. Yeah, exactly. Unlike you is what we're saying. You're saying that's a happy one. You know, this tie reflects the mood of the country. We are pleasantly surprised. How many times could you say that after watching these debates? Because there was the JD Vance hoax that was destroyed last night. We were told that this guy was a sketchball. And then many Americans, especially women, saw JD Vance last night. And they thought, this seems like the kind of guy you can bring home to your parents. He's smooth, he's polished, he's reasonable, he's civil, he's smart, he's humble. Everything that they said about him was completely the opposite. So he had a great night, but Trump even had a better night because Trump chose him. And remember the first Trump term didn't pick the best people. A lot of people are now reassured that Trump is picking the right people this time. And in a race that this is this tight, you know how they say Trump has like 94% of Republicans. Those 6% of Republicans, you call them Nikki Haley of people, never Trumpers, Chris Christie. Right. They loved JD Vance last night. I had so many texts from people like that saying, wow, JD Vance was a moment. JD Vance was amazing. And that's the kind of presentation that they long for that Trump doesn't bring to the table, but that can bring independence, women with college degrees and moderate Republicans back. So he added to the ticket and created momentum after the Democrats have had a real bad last four or five days. And that's what I think it's like. And I think that's what I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like, I think it's like I think it's like, it's like, it's like like, arm. like, you know, you look at JD Vance. they say koma. the million generation. So a lot of people that know that Trump's termed out after four are going to look at this guy who can convey the American first message with an agreeable tone. They say this is a guy for the future. You're telling me Walt's is only 48. You look so good Greg. Thanks. Okay. Click here to subscribe to the Fox News YouTube page to catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis.

Vibes at Trump HQ are 'very high' following VP debate: Leavitt,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5kV4nN4PWA,2024-10-02 19:00:31+00:00,Kamala Harris and JD Vance debate before election?,0.7760629653930664," Vice presidential nominees, JD Vance and Tim Walls are back on the campaign trail today. Last night, they squared off in their first and likely only debate, answering about some key issues, including immigration, inflation, Iran, and censorship. They were mostly civil, but very often, they did not see eye-to-eye. It's those that were closest to Donald Trump that understand how dangerous he is when the world is this dangerous. Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. Crossings are down compared to when Donald Trump left office. We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies. America, I think you've got a really clear choice on this election of who's going to honor that democracy and who's going to honor Donald Trump. You're going to hear a lot from Tim Walls this evening, and you just heard it in the answer. So, what Kamala Harris proposes to do, and some of it, I'll be honest with you, it even sounds pretty good. Here's what you won't hear, is that Kamala Harris has already done it, because she's been the vice president for three and a half years. Now, many observers are saying they didn't think that either candidate had any massive failing moments, but JD Vance took the night. Some headlines here. Tim Walls is rocked by cool JD Vance. It admits I'm a knucklehead during the VP debate. And another, it was a very midwestern debate, and Vance won. One political reporter is arguing, this is where all of those hours being grilled on the talk show circuit and talking with reporters on the trail paid off. Vance was poised. Another quote here, the Harris Wall strategy of all but hiding wall since he was in early August rollout showed tonight. Vice president Harris and Walls have only done a combined 23 interviews since their ticket formed nearly two months ago. The Trump Vance ticket at the same time, 61. Even the liberal media, with some tough words for Tim Walls' performance. I think there was a clear lack of preparation and execution here. I think the lack of interviews that he has done with national media, with local media, it showed he needed more rest. JD Vance is much more experienced at this, at public speaking, at defending himself, at pivoting. It reminded me of the June 27th debate when Kamala Harris that night said of Joe Biden, it was a slow start, but a strong finish. And that's how I felt that Tim Walls did tonight. And JD Vance needed to come away as that humble, likable guy from Hillbilly, it seemed like he did perhaps get some points in that. And focus now, Caroline Levitt, Trump 2024 national press secretary. First of all, what were the initial reactions inside the campaign last night? Well, I can tell you, Harris, that the vibes in Trump campaign headquarters today are very high. We are incredibly proud of Senator Vance. He unequivocally won last night's debate. And he proved that President Trump was right to choose him as his running mate. Senator Vance eloquently and effectively prosecuted the case against Kamala Harris' failed record. And he perfectly outlined the real solutions and plans that he and President Trump have to curb the border crisis, to end inflation, to bring back peace on the world stage. And he really pushed Governor Walls into a tough corner last night proving that Governor Walls is ill-equipped to lead at the highest level of our government, much like his running mate Kamala Harris. We have real problems on our hands right now in this country because of Kamala Harris' failed policies. The world is on fire. We have port strikers, port workers striking, causing a massive disruption in our supply chain. And you have millions of Americans still without power due to a massive hurricane with no federal government help in sight. We need real effective leadership. Senator Vance and President Trump will provide that. Yeah, you know as I was watching, and of course as a journalist, I'm always going to be watching for the questions that are asked. I was really left disappointed by how much we didn't talk about the economy, that it took so long to get there, that the port strike, that the Biden-Harris administration could have handled with the Taft Hartley Act to give an 80-day cooling-off period. That didn't get talked about because those things are affecting people right now as you point out it's the economy. Many are also pointing to this as Governor Walls' actually worse moment in the debate. He was faced with a question, Caroline, about his false claim that he was in Hong Kong or China during the Tiananmen Square massacre. And he gave a rather strange non-answer. Let's watch. Look, I grew up in small rural Nebraska, town of 400, town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the street lights come on, and I'm proud of that service. I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms, and then I used the GI Bill to become a teacher, passionate about it, a young teacher. My first year out, I got the opportunity in the summer of 89 to travel to China. 35 years ago, I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams, we would take baseball teams, we would take dancers, and we would go back and forth to China. I will be the first to tell you, I have poured my heart into my community, I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect, and I'm a knucklehead at times. Governor, just to follow up on that, the question was, can you explain the discrepancy? No, just... All I said on this was, is I got there that summer and misspoke on this. Wow. Carol one. He didn't misspeak. He lied multiple times about his visits to China. And it's a question worth asking, and I hope Governor Walls will do more media interviews clearly. He needs it as proven by his shabby debate performance last night. But clearly, how can a public schoolteacher in Minnesota afford to go to Chinese Communist China 15 times? That's a question worth asking. We know that Chinese Communist Party likes to take advantage of low-level congressional people, like Governor Tim Walls, is he compromised? We don't know. He has not sat down for interviews to answer those questions and he should. It's certainly odd that he's taken more than 10 trips to China throughout his political career. Yeah, I think it's a fair question. I didn't realize that the number could be as high as 15. And I think 15 anywhere you mentioned his teacher salary, I never feel teachers make enough money. So I'm right there with you on how did he do it? But also what was going on during all those trips. I do think that that's now got to come up. He opened the door on that I feel last night by not even being able to say when he was there definitively and to clear up the mess of whatever that misspeaking was. A voter reaction now, I want to show you with the vice presidential debate. Let's hear what voters had to say. Well, we know that JD won. Tell me, how do you feel about Walls last night? He was supposed to be this relatable guy. Did he accomplish that task last night? No, he was too nervous. Why do you think most people, when you look at the independence and the dows and even some Democrats still say JD Vance won the debate last night? I think it's because he has had more experience on public stage in the debate. And Tim Walls is just your guy next door. And I want to point out, Lawrence Jones there was in the important battleground state of Michigan. And you're hearing from the voters there. Is this commensurate with what you're hearing in those battleground states? I know they're each different, but I'm curious to know from the ground perspective inside the campaign, what are voters telling you? Yes, absolutely. And there were a plethora of polls that came out last night showing that undecided voters and the American people definitely thought Senator Vance performed better than Governor Walls. And they trust Senator Vance and President Trump to lead on the issues that matter to them at home. Because Senator Vance and both President Trump talk about those issues on the campaign trail every single day, the inflation that is decimating the savings of hardworking families, the border crisis that has led to an invasion of more than 20 million illegal people. Governor Walls couldn't answer the question last night of whether he and Kamala Harris will support mass amnesty for the more than 425,000 convicted criminal illegal aliens that we currently have in this country on their watch. He was in a tough spot having to try to explain away the failures of Kamala Harris's policies over the past four years. Americans know she and her and Joe Biden are the reason that they are struggling and they are suffering and that only a change ticket and Senator Vance and President Trump will bring real change and real solutions to this country. Yeah, it's interesting real quickly. Part of the job for each candidate last night was to shore up the top of the ticket and give some support. Do you feel like that happened for either of them last night? Definitely happened on our side. Again, Senator Vance proved that President Trump made the right decision in choosing him as his running mate. Together, they make the most dynamic ticket this country has ever seen. And they are going to be barnstorming the country over the next five weeks. Senator Vance is in Michigan today. And Trump will be there tomorrow. They will be talking directly to voters about the issues that matter to them while, again, Governor Walls continues to hide from the media. And Kamala Harris is absent in the face of these crises that the American people are facing on the world stage here at home at the impact of Hurricane Helene. And also this strike that is going to cause massive disruptions to our supply chain. She has no plan in sight to end it. Look, those two things now go together. One of the busiest ports on the East Coast is supposed to be helpful off the coast of Georgia and supplying people off the coast of Southeast. I should say, and supplying people in Georgia and other states. And it's out of commission right now. The strike is now colliding with the storm. Epic. We'll see if they show up. Caroline, thank you very much. Good to have you. Hey, everyone. I'm Emily Componio. Catch me and my co-host, Harris Volkner and Kayleigh McIntyne, on Outnumbered every weekday at 12 p.m. Eastern.

Vibes at Trump HQ are 'very high' following VP debate: Leavitt,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5kV4nN4PWA,2024-10-02 19:00:31+00:00,JD Vance replaced as Republican VP nominee?,0.6292459964752197," Vice presidential nominees, JD Vance and Tim Walls are back on the campaign trail today. Last night, they squared off in their first and likely only debate, answering about some key issues, including immigration, inflation, Iran, and censorship. They were mostly civil, but very often, they did not see eye-to-eye. It's those that were closest to Donald Trump that understand how dangerous he is when the world is this dangerous. Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. Crossings are down compared to when Donald Trump left office. We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies. America, I think you've got a really clear choice on this election of who's going to honor that democracy and who's going to honor Donald Trump. You're going to hear a lot from Tim Walls this evening, and you just heard it in the answer. So, what Kamala Harris proposes to do, and some of it, I'll be honest with you, it even sounds pretty good. Here's what you won't hear, is that Kamala Harris has already done it, because she's been the vice president for three and a half years. Now, many observers are saying they didn't think that either candidate had any massive failing moments, but JD Vance took the night. Some headlines here. Tim Walls is rocked by cool JD Vance. It admits I'm a knucklehead during the VP debate. And another, it was a very midwestern debate, and Vance won. One political reporter is arguing, this is where all of those hours being grilled on the talk show circuit and talking with reporters on the trail paid off. Vance was poised. Another quote here, the Harris Wall strategy of all but hiding wall since he was in early August rollout showed tonight. Vice president Harris and Walls have only done a combined 23 interviews since their ticket formed nearly two months ago. The Trump Vance ticket at the same time, 61. Even the liberal media, with some tough words for Tim Walls' performance. I think there was a clear lack of preparation and execution here. I think the lack of interviews that he has done with national media, with local media, it showed he needed more rest. JD Vance is much more experienced at this, at public speaking, at defending himself, at pivoting. It reminded me of the June 27th debate when Kamala Harris that night said of Joe Biden, it was a slow start, but a strong finish. And that's how I felt that Tim Walls did tonight. And JD Vance needed to come away as that humble, likable guy from Hillbilly, it seemed like he did perhaps get some points in that. And focus now, Caroline Levitt, Trump 2024 national press secretary. First of all, what were the initial reactions inside the campaign last night? Well, I can tell you, Harris, that the vibes in Trump campaign headquarters today are very high. We are incredibly proud of Senator Vance. He unequivocally won last night's debate. And he proved that President Trump was right to choose him as his running mate. Senator Vance eloquently and effectively prosecuted the case against Kamala Harris' failed record. And he perfectly outlined the real solutions and plans that he and President Trump have to curb the border crisis, to end inflation, to bring back peace on the world stage. And he really pushed Governor Walls into a tough corner last night proving that Governor Walls is ill-equipped to lead at the highest level of our government, much like his running mate Kamala Harris. We have real problems on our hands right now in this country because of Kamala Harris' failed policies. The world is on fire. We have port strikers, port workers striking, causing a massive disruption in our supply chain. And you have millions of Americans still without power due to a massive hurricane with no federal government help in sight. We need real effective leadership. Senator Vance and President Trump will provide that. Yeah, you know as I was watching, and of course as a journalist, I'm always going to be watching for the questions that are asked. I was really left disappointed by how much we didn't talk about the economy, that it took so long to get there, that the port strike, that the Biden-Harris administration could have handled with the Taft Hartley Act to give an 80-day cooling-off period. That didn't get talked about because those things are affecting people right now as you point out it's the economy. Many are also pointing to this as Governor Walls' actually worse moment in the debate. He was faced with a question, Caroline, about his false claim that he was in Hong Kong or China during the Tiananmen Square massacre. And he gave a rather strange non-answer. Let's watch.

Shocking video shows Hezbollah weapons cache hidden under child's bedroom,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o,2024-10-02 18:15:01+00:00,Will Israel target an Iranian oil or gas facility?,0.6174347400665283," The United Nations Security Council just met on Iran's unprecedented attack against Israel. And joining us now is Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Jinnon, who was at that meeting. Ambassador Jinnon, while you were speaking while you were in this meeting, we heard from our commander-in-chief President Biden at Joint Base Andrews on this conflict. Let's listen. You guys. You tell us anything about Iran and Israel's possible? Yes, look. I call the meeting to the G7 today. We're working on a joint statement all of us have re-owned. From Japan to France to Germany to southern. And what we're doing in that regard is you're making it clear that there are things that have to be done. And obviously Iran has gone way out of, I mean, has way off the board. We're going to put together a joint statement hasn't been done yet. We've been done before. We want probably a timely land. And there's no big changes in post, I'm right. Ambassador Jinnon, President Biden previously said that we must fully, fully support Israel. Do you feel that you have the support of the United States this hour? What happened last night was unprecedented. The attack against Israel, 200 ballistic missiles. We will retaliate. We will not wait for anyone else. It will be painful for Iran. I said it very clearly, the Security Council, I told the Iranian Ambassador, you will pay a price for what you did. I think it's important that the U.S. and other democracy will also impose sanctions, crippling sanctions against Iran, because today they have so much money to spend all their proxies. And we feel the results. We are being attacked from all fronts, from the Lebanon, from Gaza, from Yemen, from Iran. And it's attacked not only against Israel, it's a guard in attack against Western civilisations. The United Nations Secretary General made some really eyebrow-raising remarks before you spoke. I want to play those. But since October, exchanges of fire have expanded in scope, depth and intensity. I stated that almost daily exchanges of fire by a small and other non-state armed groups in Lebanon and the Israel defence forces are in repeated violation of Security Council Resolution 1701. You know, I'm looking at your face there. That is the head of the UN, putting Hezbollah on the same moral plateau as the IDF, the day after. And I want to play this for our viewers. Your Israeli defence forces found a tunnel in Hezbollah beneath a child's bedroom with a cache of weapons underneath and a plan to commit October 7th from the north. What do you think when you hear the head of the UN equivocate your country to Hezbollah? Okay. That's shameful. And it's not the first time since October 7th, the Secretary General and other officials here at the UN, they made the small equation between the aggressor and us who are defending ourselves. And even last night, after the attack from Iran, the Secretary General couldn't even mention Iran in his statement. He called for the escalation. Like you have to equal sides playing a game. That's unacceptable. You know, imagine that during World War II, while the Allies fought Nazi Germany, the UN would have called for both sides to de-escalate. The UN was not in place back then, but it was formed exactly in order to avoid such scenarios. And we think today that when you have a crisis, instead of standing with the side that is defending itself, the UN is doing exactly the opposite. The committee sides asked the one about defending our people, but we are strong. You know, Kerry, tonight you're going to celebrate the Jewish newlywashed Shana. It has been a very tough year for us. We are in deep pain. But we are strong. We are determined. And we will win. We will make sure that the Iran will pay a price. And we have shown our capabilities already in Gaza and in Lebanon. Yes. Well, final question to you. And it is pretty incredible. The largest ballistic missile attack in history and the head of the UN fails to condemn Iran in his paper statement. Last question. That terror attack that happened yesterday that left a beautiful mother dead as she was shielding her nine-month-old. Any indication as to who was behind that? Yes. Hamas took responsibility. We are still checking if there was coordination between Hamas and Iran because, you know, minutes after this massacre, the rockets flew into Israel. So I think there was a connection, but we are looking into that. But you mentioned that story, but we have other stories. Seven Israelis were massacred in the streets of Tel Aviv. That's painful. And we are fighting in on front. Israel is under attack. We are strong. We are civilians. And we will win this war. We have no choice. I will tell you, my family prays for a little fear and aerial beabuse every single night. We pray for the release of those hostages, the safety of Israel. Thank you, Ambassador."

And we feel the results. We are being attacked from all fronts, from the Lebanon, from Gaza, from Yemen, from Iran. And it's attacked not only against Israel, it's a guard in attack against Western civilisations. The United Nations Secretary General made some really eyebrow-raising remarks before you spoke. I want to play those. But since October, exchanges of fire have expanded in scope, depth and intensity. I stated that almost daily exchanges of fire by a small and other non-state armed groups in Lebanon and the Israel defence forces are in repeated violation of Security Council Resolution 1701. You know, I'm looking at your face there. That is the head of the UN, putting Hezbollah on the same moral plateau as the IDF, the day after. And I want to play this for our viewers. Your Israeli defence forces found a tunnel in Hezbollah beneath a child's bedroom with a cache of weapons underneath and a plan to commit October 7th from the north. What do you think when you hear the head of the UN equivocate your country to Hezbollah? Okay. That's shameful. And it's not the first time since October 7th, the Secretary General and other officials here at the UN, they made the small equation between the aggressor and us who are defending ourselves. And even last night, after the attack from Iran, the Secretary General couldn't even mention Iran in his statement. He called for the escalation. Like you have to equal sides playing a game. That's unacceptable. You know, imagine that during World War II, while the Allies fought Nazi Germany, the UN would have called for both sides to de-escalate. The UN was not in place back then, but it was formed exactly in order to avoid such scenarios. And we think today that when you have a crisis, instead of standing with the side that is defending itself, the UN is doing exactly the opposite. The committee sides asked the one about defending our people, but we are strong. You know, Kerry, tonight you're going to celebrate the Jewish newlywashed Shana. It has been a very tough year for us. We are in deep pain. But we are strong. We are determined. And we will win. We will make sure that the Iran will pay a price. And we have shown our capabilities already in Gaza and in Lebanon. Yes. Well, final question to you. And it is pretty incredible. The largest ballistic missile attack in history and the head of the UN fails to condemn Iran in his paper statement. Last question. That terror attack that happened yesterday that left a beautiful mother dead as she was shielding her nine-month-old. Any indication as to who was behind that? Yes. Hamas took responsibility. We are still checking if there was coordination between Hamas and Iran because, you know, minutes after this massacre, the rockets flew into Israel. So I think there was a connection, but we are looking into that. But you mentioned that story, but we have other stories. Seven Israelis were massacred in the streets of Tel Aviv. That's painful. And we are fighting in on front. Israel is under attack. We are strong. We are civilians. And we will win this war. We have no choice. I will tell you, my family prays for a little fear and aerial beabuse every single night. We pray for the release of those hostages, the safety of Israel. Thank you, Ambassador."
Shocking video shows Hezbollah weapons cache hidden under child's bedroom,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5ZqeFT28o,2024-10-02 18:15:01+00:00,Will Israel target Tehran?,0.6064369678497314," The United Nations Security Council just met on Iran's unprecedented attack against Israel. And joining us now is Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Jinnon, who was at that meeting. Ambassador Jinnon, while you were speaking while you were in this meeting, we heard from our commander-in-chief President Biden at Joint Base Andrews on this conflict. Let's listen. You guys. You tell us anything about Iran and Israel's possible? Yes, look. I call the meeting to the G7 today. We're working on a joint statement all of us have re-owned. From Japan to France to Germany to southern. And what we're doing in that regard is you're making it clear that there are things that have to be done. And obviously Iran has gone way out of, I mean, has way off the board. We're going to put together a joint statement hasn't been done yet. We've been done before. We want probably a timely land. And there's no big changes in post, I'm right. Ambassador Jinnon, President Biden previously said that we must fully, fully support Israel. Do you feel that you have the support of the United States this hour? What happened last night was unprecedented. The attack against Israel, 200 ballistic missiles. We will retaliate. We will not wait for anyone else. It will be painful for Iran. I said it very clearly, the Security Council, I told the Iranian Ambassador, you will pay a price for what you did. I think it's important that the U.S. and other democracy will also impose sanctions, crippling sanctions against Iran, because today they have so much money to spend all their proxies.

Israel could inflict massive damage on Iran: Sen. Tom Cotton,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfdPC8ogi-0,2024-10-02 16:00:41+00:00,Will Israel target Tehran?,0.6296223402023315," The Biden-Harris administration says the U.S. is standing by its ally. We're proud of the actions that we've taken alongside Israel to protect and defend Israel. We have made clear that there will be consequences, severe consequences for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case. But as Tufts' off, really working here to react, Senator Tom Cotton, Senator, your reaction to what we've done, knocking down at least 10 missiles heading towards Israel last night, but they knocked over the bulk of it themselves. Sure. Well, it's important that the United States support Israel to defend against missile attacks, but that's defense. And you can't win wars on the defense. Israel is in a multi-front war against Iran and its ring of fire. Now yesterday, the veil dropped when Iran attacked Israel for the second time this year directly, but Hamas is backed by Iran. Hezbollah is fully backed by Iran. Iran has a terror army and Yemen that shootings missiles at Israel. Israel, though, has a chance after its accomplishments against Hezbollah in the last very weeks to totally remake the strategic map in the Middle East. Hezbollah has over 100,000 missiles and rockets. That's been like a loaded gun pointed at Israel's head for years. That's been Iran's main deterrent. But because Israel's so thoroughly penetrated Hezbollah, because it's decapitated Hezbollah's leadership, now, by some reports, it's destroyed over half of that arsenal. It has a chance to totally expose Iran on its flanks. The United States needs to back Israel to the hilt. That's the opposite of what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have done for the last year, putting more pressure on Israel than they do on Iran's terror network. Nobody wants a war. We have huge assets in the area, but no one has to tell you, Senator Cotton, that Iran is behind the attacks, the militias that killed three of our guys in Syria. We never avenge them. They've shut down the Red Sea shooting at our ships with their drones, $100 drones for a million dollar defensive rockets. We have allowed this to happen. They're shooting at us. Our ally is under attack at the same people that are shooting at us. Should we be doing more? Yeah, Brian, we're not going to have a war. Iran has been exposed as something of a brittle military and a fickle ally. I think there's a lot of people sitting in Hamas and Hezbollah and Yemen wondering why has Iran not done more? Why when they struck Israel yesterday for the second time in six months, could they not kill a single Israeli or blow up a single critical facility in Israel? Again, Iran has been exposed on its flanks right now. Israel has a chance to inflict massive retaliatory damage on Iran and remake the map of the Middle East. That's good not only for Israel, it's good for us and our interests and our citizens in the region. It's good for all of our Arab allies. You may have noticed, did not say a single word, critical of Israel yesterday, as it was saying, that it's going to strike back against Iran. We haven't historic window. We'll see if he's going to take it. Maybe to capitate the Iranian regime, whose people ate them and would love for us to be there for him. Yesterday, one of the things that stood out was when Governor Walts was asked about where he was when T.E.N.M. and Square and the uprising there with the beat down of the citizens. He said he was there. It was exposed that he was not there. He says he misspoke and that he's a, sometimes he's a knucklehead. Is that okay? No, I mean, I think it's been clear now that he's had a serial embellishments about his record. What troubles me more about where he was in the summer of 1989 is the repeated trips he's taken to China over the years. Dozens of trips to China, many of which were funded by the Chinese Communist Party. This is a classic effort that Chinese communists use to groom and cultivate Americans who may move on to leadership. And look what's happened. He went from being a high school history or civics teacher to becoming a congressman and now he's the vice president. He needs to explain to the American people a lot more about what his relationship was with China over the last three decades and why he just coincidentally took such a soft line on Chinese communism in Congress and as governor. See, and he's compromised. I'm saying that this is a classic pattern of how China tries to cultivate American leaders at the lowest levels, turn them into a China lobby for their federal representatives in Washington. And if they become one of those representatives or become a governor, then China has hit the jackpot. And remember, the spy here was consulting with the governor of New York and we know one was dating Eric Swalwell. Come, Steve. Great to see you, Senator. Thank you. And we'll quote the scene again soon. I'm Steve Doosie. I'm Brian Killme.

Laura Ingraham: Any doubts about JD Vance should be put to rest,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si07Vrgfjrk,2024-10-02 12:15:03+00:00,3 Trump vs. Harris debates before election?,0.6530336141586304," So let's get around the table and see what folks thought. Yeah, I thought it was interesting. The center of advanced pointed time. And again, you heard it in his clothes that Vice President Harris has been in office for three and a half years. When it came to weak policy on Iran, the first question is dealing with that Iranian missile strike into Israel. On immigration and border issues, on inflation, coming back again and again to that. Governor Walce did appear nervous at first, but seemed to find his stride on the abortion stretch of questions where he talked about personal stories of women seeking abortions and restrictive states. But he really had a tough moment when he was asked about why he said he was in Hong Kong for the Tiananmen Square protests when he was actually really in Nebraska. He said sometimes he just says things and he's a knucklehead talking about things. Again, no questions about China, no questions about Ukraine. And there was some questions about fact checking and whether it was fair and balanced across the way. Here with us tonight, Danipirino, Harold Ford Jr., Laura Angra, Jesse Waters, Britt Hume, John J. for Motley, Britt, your thoughts coming out of this debate? Well, the moderators were obnoxious and made it feel like three on one on advance. And Vance was just fine. He seems to have been, his skills as a debater and a speaker, seem to have been owned to some extent by just these several months on the campaign trail. And for one so young, he seemed in terms of his knowledge of policy to run rings around poor governor walls, who I think did not have a very great night. As you say, Brett, he got better as a night war on. But if you're reading this debate on points, it wasn't close. Vance had a good night. Laura, would you take? Well, for those who question Trump's choice of Vance as his vice presidential running mate, I think those doubts should have been put to rest tonight. I don't think, and I've been with my eighth presidential campaign, I think I covered. I don't think I've ever seen a Republican, so definitely maneuver. What was smug and arrogant bias on the part of those moderators? Almost every question was designed to make Republicans look bad, slanting Trump's views on child care. And yet Vance seemed to take it all and stride. And he really, I think with most questions, really showed his humanity and also his knowledge of the issues. I don't think he could have done better under the circumstances. And I think that is very reassuring to the public who thought he was perhaps an ogre or anti-woman or didn't like kids or some strange concoction of the stereotype that they were selling. Harold, I don't disagree with anything that's been said. I was listening to some of the issues and really what I was looking for at the very beginning. Was he likable? Well, the kidnets likable and optimistic. I think they both were. I think Senator Vance probably had a little better edge there because all the things that have been said about him were they smart, analogable. There's no doubt both were. At the beginning, it seemed that Governor Wallace was a little rattled and Senator Vance came out stronger and certainly assured himself, which helped him well, where they were relatable. I thought both of them, one of the more remarkable things, they seemed to like each other. They shook hands. They talked about things they agreed on on child care and other things. I agree with you abortion was where he really got his stride going. And finally, can you see both of them as president? I think Senator Vance had himself a good job and he's a young guy, walks as a little older and both of them seem to have had some confidence in him. But there's no question on the economy and on immigration. I think that the Republicans still have their advantage in on January 6th and abortion and health care. A Republican's having on the other excuse me and Democrats have it on that. You know, Dana, obviously the Trump fan side is trying to reach out to improve those numbers with women. On the other side for Harris and Walt, they need to improve their numbers with men. And you could feel both of them trying to do that at times tonight. Did they succeed? Well, Vance did and Walt did not. You can understand why the Democrats spent the entire week trying to lower expectations for walls. The only problem is for Democrats, they underperformed because the expectations should have been even lower than that. For any Republican or independent who is concerned about Vance, I actually think on the other side is so many Democrats tonight saying why did Kamala Harris not pick Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania? Because I think that might have been a different debate. This made a concerted effort to talk directly to swing voters. I don't think it was just women, but certainly men who might have been on the fence. I don't think he, I don't know what Walt stood on that point for men. I do think that you're going to see a lot of the media say why can't Vance just say Trump didn't win in 2020? And they're going to try to hang that on him. And I think there will not be another debate, but I wouldn't be surprised if Kamala Harris doesn't want that to be the last word on a national stage. 35 days left and that could have been the last debate. We'll see. That's what they're saying right now. I'm Steve Doocy. I'm Brian Killme.

Harold, I don't disagree with anything that's been said. I was listening to some of the issues and really what I was looking for at the very beginning. Was he likable? Well, the kidnets likable and optimistic. I think they both were. I think Senator Vance probably had a little better edge there because all the things that have been said about him were they smart, analogable. There's no doubt both were. At the beginning, it seemed that Governor Wallace was a little rattled and Senator Vance came out stronger and certainly assured himself, which helped him well, where they were relatable. I thought both of them, one of the more remarkable things, they seemed to like each other. They shook hands. They talked about things they agreed on on child care and other things. I agree with you abortion was where he really got his stride going. And finally, can you see both of them as president? I think Senator Vance had himself a good job and he's a young guy, walks as a little older and both of them seem to have had some confidence in him. But there's no question on the economy and on immigration. I think that the Republicans still have their advantage in on January 6th and abortion and health care. A Republican's having on the other excuse me and Democrats have it on that. You know, Dana, obviously the Trump fan side is trying to reach out to improve those numbers with women. On the other side for Harris and Walt, they need to improve their numbers with men. And you could feel both of them trying to do that at times tonight. Did they succeed? Well, Vance did and Walt did not. You can understand why the Democrats spent the entire week trying to lower expectations for walls. The only problem is for Democrats, they underperformed because the expectations should have been even lower than that. For any Republican or independent who is concerned about Vance, I actually think on the other side is so many Democrats tonight saying why did Kamala Harris not pick Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania? Because I think that might have been a different debate. This made a concerted effort to talk directly to swing voters. I don't think it was just women, but certainly men who might have been on the fence. I don't think he, I don't know what Walt stood on that point for men. I do think that you're going to see a lot of the media say why can't Vance just say Trump didn't win in 2020? And they're going to try to hang that on him. And I think there will not be another debate, but I wouldn't be surprised if Kamala Harris doesn't want that to be the last word on a national stage. 35 days left and that could have been the last debate.

Laura Ingraham: Any doubts about JD Vance should be put to rest,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si07Vrgfjrk,2024-10-02 12:15:03+00:00,4+ Trump vs. Harris debates before election?,0.6176556348800659," So let's get around the table and see what folks thought. Yeah, I thought it was interesting. The center of advanced pointed time. And again, you heard it in his clothes that Vice President Harris has been in office for three and a half years. When it came to weak policy on Iran, the first question is dealing with that Iranian missile strike into Israel. On immigration and border issues, on inflation, coming back again and again to that. Governor Walce did appear nervous at first, but seemed to find his stride on the abortion stretch of questions where he talked about personal stories of women seeking abortions and restrictive states. But he really had a tough moment when he was asked about why he said he was in Hong Kong for the Tiananmen Square protests when he was actually really in Nebraska. He said sometimes he just says things and he's a knucklehead talking about things. Again, no questions about China, no questions about Ukraine. And there was some questions about fact checking and whether it was fair and balanced across the way. Here with us tonight, Danipirino, Harold Ford Jr., Laura Angra, Jesse Waters, Britt Hume, John J. for Motley, Britt, your thoughts coming out of this debate? Well, the moderators were obnoxious and made it feel like three on one on advance. And Vance was just fine. He seems to have been, his skills as a debater and a speaker, seem to have been owned to some extent by just these several months on the campaign trail. And for one so young, he seemed in terms of his knowledge of policy to run rings around poor governor walls, who I think did not have a very great night. As you say, Brett, he got better as a night war on. But if you're reading this debate on points, it wasn't close. Vance had a good night. Laura, would you take? Well, for those who question Trump's choice of Vance as his vice presidential running mate, I think those doubts should have been put to rest tonight. I don't think, and I've been with my eighth presidential campaign, I think I covered. I don't think I've ever seen a Republican, so definitely maneuver. What was smug and arrogant bias on the part of those moderators? Almost every question was designed to make Republicans look bad, slanting Trump's views on child care. And yet Vance seemed to take it all and stride. And he really, I think with most questions, really showed his humanity and also his knowledge of the issues. I don't think he could have done better under the circumstances. And I think that is very reassuring to the public who thought he was perhaps an ogre or anti-woman or didn't like kids or some strange concoction of the stereotype that they were selling.

Israel vows retaliation after 'unprecedented' Iranian missile attack,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGs_ngYvrdE,2024-10-02 11:30:10+00:00,Another Iran strike on Israel by Friday?,0.6666642427444458," We are back with a Fox News Alert right now. The IDF is sending even more troops into Southern Lebanon after Iran unleashed nearly 200 ballistic missiles on Israel yesterday. Eight boy live on the ground in Tel Aviv with the latest Nate. Hey guys, good morning. So Israel and Hezbollah are continuing to exchange heavy fire across the border this morning just one day after the biggest ballistic missile strike in history. Assigned that the war continues just a really scary night last night across Central and Southern Israel as you see 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran into Israel. Many of them shot down by Israel's air defense and international partners in the region, including the United States. The big question here guys is what is Israel going to do in response to this? Several Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say that a Iran will pay a significant price for this. We know that 100 homes in a town north of Tel Aviv are damaged after being hit by falling shrapnel. The attack sent millions of people into bomb shelters, including one man that we talked to who was injured while fighting for the IDF in Gaza. Listen to this. What happened with your injury? How you lost a lower party? The last I. I was shot in a RPG and I got injured. It's hard for me to look at because in time like this, it's very difficult to deal with my situation in my country. Situation. He said that he was so calm because he was so confident in the country's air defense, but check this out guys. Literally minutes before Iran's attack, a terror attack happened in Jaffa in Tel Aviv to terrorist open fire on Israelis, riding the light rail train through the city. Listen to this. When the train stopped and open its doors, the terrorists walked inside, started firing their automatic weapons, walked back outside and continued their killing spree. Take a look at this new video from Bay Road. Israel continued its air strikes in the Dahia neighborhood overnight targeting Hezbollah's weapons facilities. That's the same neighborhood where they took out Hassan Nisrella in an air strike on Friday and as you mentioned, as Israel continues its limited ground offensive into Southern Lebanon, they are calling up additional troops to supplement the ones already there this morning as we await Israel's response. And as we wait for that, Iran has already said that if Israel responds, then they will respond in turn. So it looks like we could have a couple busy days here. We'll send it back to you. All right, Nate, for our live for us in Tel Aviv, you are certainly right about that. Nate, thank you so much. Let's bring in Anya Kravine, who is currently in a safe room of her home as a result of yesterday's attack. She's also the senior director for the defense of democracies. Anya, good morning to you. Thank you so much for joining us following yesterday's events. We have a map that shows just how massive this barrage of incoming missiles was. I mean, it's the entire expanse of Israel where these missiles landed and the air defense systems took them out. So just want to get a sense of what this was like to live through. What did you see here, field during this attack? Sure. Thanks so much for having me. So already on Monday, people in Israel were hearing that there were rumors coming out of the US administration that Iran might be considering an attack in the coming days. And then, of course, on Tuesday afternoon, yesterday afternoon, my kids came home from school and they were hanging around the house. And I think that's what we are going to do. We're going to have a little bit of a conversation about the situation. And I think that's what we are going to do today. We're going to have a conversation with the young people. We're going to have a conversation with the young people from school and they were hanging around the house. And I started seeing language coming out of the Israeli media, which I've learned to recognize as, kind of, you know, brace yourself. Essentially, the guidance from Homeland Security said in certain areas you can only gather to so many people, stay close to your shelters. And then the language from the media started changing. And, you know, the media plays a huge role when they have these attacks, which we've seen a couple of times from Iran that was won in April and then, of course, the one yesterday. And the media start saying things like, become, if there's a siren, go calmly to your shelter, don't run. They remind people that most of the injuries happen on the way to the shelter. So, at that point, I told my kids to stay close to the house. Daniel Hagarri, the IDF spokesman, came on the air and said, look, we're hearing rumors. We think something's coming, but there's nothing in the air right now. In other words, stay calm and stay calm. Proceed is normal. I started putting my kids to bed. And then, just as we were sort of getting into the nighttime routine, my husband said, OK, climb together in the safe room. We all came downstairs, piled into the safe room, brought the dog in, and turned the news on and just saw this barrage unprecedented barrage of ballistic missiles over Israel's capital, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Those were the primary images we're having again. What I think to live through and we're looking at images of the people who are looking at images of the iron dome, the events systems taking out some of those ballistic missiles. Israelis are used to living through these types of things, but even this attack, the largest from Iran, is a historic event. So now, Prime Minister Benjamin Niyaho, we're hearing from him directly. He is vowing retaliation. And there are those, and you could put many in the Biden administration in this camp, who fear that retaliation will lead to escalation. And then others are saying peace through strength. Israel is in this unique window of the world. And then, the people who are in the world are having a chance at the world. And then, as the regime is trying to predict the path of the natural economic growth of the nation, we can think that Israel is in this unique window of time where they could destabilize Iran to the point of change. So, what do you think about that? What will and what needs to take place moving forward? So, it's hard to predict the future, but I can say from Israel's perspective, Iran has been making a race towards a nuclear weapon for several years. And it's only because of US that it hasn't gotten there yet. It hasn't achieved this nuclear weapon. Of course, none of Israel's adversaries currently have the ability to destroy the Jewish state with conventional means. There's no military that's going to show up in Israel's borders and destroy the country. Israel has the quality of military edge, largely thanks to its strategic alliance with the US. But that is where terror comes in. And right now, Iran's strategy for decades has been to surround Israel with Iranian proxies and to try to make life unlivable. And that is where the heart of the October 7th attack, that is what Hispela has been doing to Israel's north for the past year. And that is what Iran continues to attempt to do. So if this escalates, Israel's already said that Israel intends to retaliate a significant retaliation for yesterday's garage, keep in mind that these ballistic missiles, some of them are as big as buses. So you have a 180, essentially, explosive laden buses falling from the sky. It's a miracle that no one was killed. One person, a Palestinian, ironically, was killed in the West Bank. But no one in Israel was injured from the attack. So this is a significant attack. And it deserves a significant response. And that's what Israel is now promising. And it's even saying that if it continues to escalate, that nothing is off the table. And Iran's nuclear program might be in Israel's sights. Right, yeah. And Israel right now is fighting a three-front war. Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis in Yemen. You weaken one of them. You weaken the whole regime. And that is Israel's goal. And yeah, thank you so much for joining us. We're so glad that you're safe. Safe. We appreciate your insight, as always. Thank you. Todd, over to you."

Thank you so much for joining us following yesterday's events. We have a map that shows just how massive this barrage of incoming missiles was. I mean, it's the entire expanse of Israel where these missiles landed and the air defense systems took them out. So just want to get a sense of what this was like to live through. What did you see here, field during this attack? Sure. Thanks so much for having me. So already on Monday, people in Israel were hearing that there were rumors coming out of the US administration that Iran might be considering an attack in the coming days. And then, of course, on Tuesday afternoon, yesterday afternoon, my kids came home from school and they were hanging around the house. And I think that's what we are going to do. We're going to have a little bit of a conversation about the situation. And I think that's what we are going to do today. We're going to have a conversation with the young people. We're going to have a conversation with the young people from school and they were hanging around the house. And I started seeing language coming out of the Israeli media, which I've learned to recognize as, kind of, you know, brace yourself. Essentially, the guidance from Homeland Security said in certain areas you can only gather to so many people, stay close to your shelters. And then the language from the media started changing. And, you know, the media plays a huge role when they have these attacks, which we've seen a couple of times from Iran that was won in April and then, of course, the one yesterday. And the media start saying things like, become, if there's a siren, go calmly to your shelter, don't run. They remind people that most of the injuries happen on the way to the shelter. So, at that point, I told my kids to stay close to the house. Daniel Hagarri, the IDF spokesman, came on the air and said, look, we're hearing rumors. We think something's coming, but there's nothing in the air right now. In other words, stay calm and stay calm. Proceed is normal. I started putting my kids to bed. And then, just as we were sort of getting into the nighttime routine, my husband said, OK, climb together in the safe room. We all came downstairs, piled into the safe room, brought the dog in, and turned the news on and just saw this barrage unprecedented barrage of ballistic missiles over Israel's capital, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Those were the primary images we're having again. What I think to live through and we're looking at images of the people who are looking at images of the iron dome, the events systems taking out some of those ballistic missiles. Israelis are used to living through these types of things, but even this attack, the largest from Iran, is a historic event. So now, Prime Minister Benjamin Niyaho, we're hearing from him directly. He is vowing retaliation. And there are those, and you could put many in the Biden administration in this camp, who fear that retaliation will lead to escalation. And then others are saying peace through strength. Israel is in this unique window of the world. And then, the people who are in the world are having a chance at the world. And then, as the regime is trying to predict the path of the natural economic growth of the nation, we can think that Israel is in this unique window of time where they could destabilize Iran to the point of change. So, what do you think about that? What will and what needs to take place moving forward? So, it's hard to predict the future, but I can say from Israel's perspective, Iran has been making a race towards a nuclear weapon for several years. And it's only because of US that it hasn't gotten there yet. It hasn't achieved this nuclear weapon. Of course, none of Israel's adversaries currently have the ability to destroy the Jewish state with conventional means. There's no military that's going to show up in Israel's borders and destroy the country. Israel has the quality of military edge, largely thanks to its strategic alliance with the US. But that is where terror comes in. And right now, Iran's strategy for decades has been to surround Israel with Iranian proxies and to try to make life unlivable. And that is where the heart of the October 7th attack, that is what Hispela has been doing to Israel's north for the past year. And that is what Iran continues to attempt to do. So if this escalates, Israel's already said that Israel intends to retaliate a significant retaliation for yesterday's garage, keep in mind that these ballistic missiles, some of them are as big as buses. So you have a 180, essentially, explosive laden buses falling from the sky. It's a miracle that no one was killed. One person, a Palestinian, ironically, was killed in the West Bank. But no one in Israel was injured from the attack. So this is a significant attack. And it deserves a significant response. And that's what Israel is now promising. And it's even saying that if it continues to escalate, that nothing is off the table. And Iran's nuclear program might be in Israel's sights. Right, yeah. And Israel right now is fighting a three-front war. Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis in Yemen. You weaken one of them. You weaken the whole regime. And that is Israel's goal. And yeah, thank you so much for joining us. We're so glad that you're safe. Safe. We appreciate your insight, as always. Thank you. Todd, over to you."

The IDF is sending even more troops into Southern Lebanon after Iran unleashed nearly 200 ballistic missiles on Israel yesterday. Eight boy live on the ground in Tel Aviv with the latest Nate. Hey guys, good morning. So Israel and Hezbollah are continuing to exchange heavy fire across the border this morning just one day after the biggest ballistic missile strike in history. Assigned that the war continues just a really scary night last night across Central and Southern Israel as you see 180 ballistic missiles launched by Iran into Israel. Many of them shot down by Israel's air defense and international partners in the region, including the United States. The big question here guys is what is Israel going to do in response to this? Several Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say that a Iran will pay a significant price for this. We know that 100 homes in a town north of Tel Aviv are damaged after being hit by falling shrapnel. The attack sent millions of people into bomb shelters, including one man that we talked to who was injured while fighting for the IDF in Gaza. Listen to this. What happened with your injury? How you lost a lower party? The last I. I was shot in a RPG and I got injured. It's hard for me to look at because in time like this, it's very difficult to deal with my situation in my country. Situation. He said that he was so calm because he was so confident in the country's air defense, but check this out guys. Literally minutes before Iran's attack, a terror attack happened in Jaffa in Tel Aviv to terrorist open fire on Israelis, riding the light rail train through the city. Listen to this. When the train stopped and open its doors, the terrorists walked inside, started firing their automatic weapons, walked back outside and continued their killing spree. Take a look at this new video from Bay Road. Israel continued its air strikes in the Dahia neighborhood overnight targeting Hezbollah's weapons facilities. That's the same neighborhood where they took out Hassan Nisrella in an air strike on Friday and as you mentioned, as Israel continues its limited ground offensive into Southern Lebanon, they are calling up additional troops to supplement the ones already there this morning as we await Israel's response. And as we wait for that, Iran has already said that if Israel responds, then they will respond in turn. So it looks like we could have a couple busy days here. We'll send it back to you.

"CBS moderators RIPPED for fact-checking JD Vance, cutting off mics",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWCVeRg-idA,2024-10-02 10:45:03+00:00,Kamala Harris and JD Vance debate before election?,0.6042336225509644," Last night's moderators promised us they would take a step back on the fact checking, and let the VP candidates correct each other. But it only took about 25 minutes for us to get this heated moment. Thank you, Governor, and just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected. Margaret, the rules were that you got to work on a fact check. And since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on. There's an application called the CBP1 app, where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole, and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. Thank you, Senator, for describing the legal process. And Kamala Harris opened up that, right? Those laws have been in the books since 1990. Thank you, gentlemen. We want to have. The CBP1 app has not been on the books since 1990. It's something that Kamala Harris created. And you're the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut. No, the audience heard Joe Conch is a Fox News contributor, and he joins me now. Joe, I guess CBS is no fact checking by the moderator's rule. Only applies if candidates stick to CBS's narratives around things like Springfield and Immigration. Joe? Well, butter my button. Call me a biscuit. I can't believe we saw bias from the CBS moderators last night, Todd. I mean, Arboretum during the post-debate coverage called the moderators, quote, obnoxious, unquote. And that was the perfect word to apply here. Laura Angram called the fact checks smug and arrogant bias, and they're both right. This was journalistic malfeasance. CBS promised the moderators to your point were not going to fact check. And then when they did, of course, three times all the fact checks were on JD Vance and none on Tim Walls. Two was credit as you just showed. JD Vance pushed back and fact check the fact check yet didn't lose as cool. So for all keeping score at home right now, over two debates, eight fact checks for Donald Trump and JD Vance combined during ABC and CBS's debates respectively, zero fact checks of Kamala Harris and Tim Walls on the same two networks. And case you're wondering about the whole smug and arrogant bias thing, Todd. I'm shocked. I'm shocked to hear that. But you know what? We both like hockey. This was a one on three shorthanded situation and JD Vance scored all the goals each time, very impressive by him. I want to get your thoughts on this. ABC anchor Lindsey Davis of that name sounds familiar. She did one of the debates, you know, the Harris, Trump one. Comparison Tim Walls' debate performance to Joe Biden's. Listen. It kind of reminded me of the June 27th debate when Kamala Harris that night said of Joe Biden. It was a slow start, but a strong finish. And that's how I felt that Tim Walls kind of did tonight, you know, to use Tim Walls' own words. I mean, a lot about this debate tonight was, was weird. There were uncomfortable cringey moments. Uncomfortable and cringey, Joe, you heard similar sentiments on CNN and other left wing media outlets. So my question to you, now that the entire country, not just the Fox News viewer, has seen Tim Walls exposed. Will that have any impact on the Harris Walls ticket and the election in general? Well, the ticket will stay intact certainly, but in the end, I think what we're probably finding is many who are supporting that the Harris Walls ticket have buyers remorse this morning because they had that one inch putt, or at least Kamala Harris did, when she could choose any running mate and she had Josh Shapiro out there, a Pennsylvania governor in a blue state or a purple state, I should say, that is at 65% approval. You win Pennsylvania, you probably win this election. She had Shapiro right there and she went for Tim Walls instead, which brings nothing to the ticket. And as we saw from that debate last night, obviously was outclassed by JD Vance, where this was a masterclass, by the way. The Senator Kim McCawson's likable empathetic, he was knowledgeable, he was confident. Well, Tim Walls, who often, especially during the first half of that debate, appeared nervous, overwhelmed, not confident and rehearsed. So that's where we're at at this point. I don't know if this moves the needle that much and I'll leave it here, Todd, but JD Vance, his favorables went up something like 25 points and some polls I saw after this debate. So the Trump Vance ticket benefited far more from this night, watched by 60 million people than the Tim Walls and Kamala Harris ticket. And you know what else this debate did? It put to rest all that JD Vance's weird nonsense coming from left because if that's weird, I'll sign up for weird every day of the week. That's what a president should look like. Joe Concha, thank you much for your time. We appreciate it. I'm Steve Doosie, I'm Brian Killme.

Sean Hannity:  Tim Walz was visibly nervous,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9jCniZ5Yh0,2024-10-02 04:00:39+00:00,Kamala Harris blowout victory?,0.6412184238433838," Welcome to Hannity, the first, the only Vice Presidential debate is now in the books. We are live. We are in the spin room. We are in New York City. Now, coming up tonight, we're going to get reaction from Senator Ted Cruz, Donald Trump Jr. is here. The vape, Ramaswami, the man of the hour, JD Vance will be coming into the spin room. I think, kind of, wipe the floor with Tim Walls, who seem very nervous all night. Make no mistake. This was a consequential debate. It will, in my view, register in the polls and will boost Donald Trump. You decide. When did Iran and Hamas and their proxies attack Israel? It was during the administration of Kamala Harris. Ask yourself at home. When, when was the last time? I'm 40 years old. When was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict breakout? The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president. Look, we all want to solve it. I, most of us want to solve this. And that is the United States Congress. That's the board of patrol agents. The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris' open border. It is a disgrace to him. And I actually think, I agree with you. I think you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does. You're going to hear a lot from Tim Walls this evening, and you just heard it in the answer. A lot of what Kamala Harris proposes to do. And some of it, I'll be honest with you. It even sounds pretty good. Here's what you won't hear. Is that Kamala Harris has already done it. If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle-class problems, then she ought to do them now. Not one asking for promotion, but in the job the American people gave her three and a half years ago. What Tim Walls is doing, and I honestly, Tim, I think you got a tough job here. Because you've got to play whack-a-mole. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take-home pay, which of course he did. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation, which of course he did. And then you simultaneously got to defend Kamala Harris's atrocious economic record, which has made gas, groceries, and housing unaffordable for American citizens. Now, well, soon to be maybe, Vice President Vance was measured. He was prepared, compassionate, obviously smart, intelligent, bright, showed a lot of compassion. And the country really got to meet JD Vance tonight, not a caricature of the media mob, state-run media mob created of him. And as they do, Donald Trump, meanwhile Tim Wall, he didn't look very comfortable, visibly nervous, constantly making well-kind of weird faces, trying to deliver rehearsed lines. Tim Walls also lied over and over again. We fact-checked him. Lied about taxes, pretended only the wealthy Americans would see a tax hike under the Harris and Walls administration. That's false. He lied about the border, pretending that illegal immigration numbers are lower than under Trump, which is false, totally false. He lied about abortion. He lied about housing. He lied about inflation. 2025, the project that only exists in their mind. He lied about regulations. And when asked about another lie surrounding his time in China, Tim Walls kind of embarrassed himself. This is a moment to watch. Governor Walls, you said you were in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protest in the spring of 1989. But Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are reporting that you actually didn't travel to Asia until August of that year. Can you explain that discrepancy? Yes, I'm going to ask. Well, into the folks out there, I didn't get at the top of this. Look, I grew up in small rural Nebraska, town of 400, town that you rode your bike with your buddy, still the street lights come on, and I'm proud of that service. Now, look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. They look, I will be the first to tell you, I have poured my heart into my community. I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect, and I'm a knucklehead at times. I will say more than anything. Many times I will talk a lot, I will get caught up in the rhetoric. But being there, the impact it made, the difference it made in my life, I learned a lot about China. Governor, just to follow up on that, the question was, can you explain the discrepancy? No, just... All I said on this was is I got there that summer and mispoke on this. So I will just... That's what I've said. Now Tim Walsh clearly in over his head, despite plenty of assistance from the, well, lately by a CBS moderators, Walsh didn't look pretty good, didn't look good in any way tonight. And by the way, CBS, they should frankly be ashamed. They didn't keep to the rules, so-called moderators immediately broke their promise, not to serve as fact checkers, in order to help Tim Walsh, and push their own political views as, quote, facts. Meanwhile, this country and the world are absolutely deteriorating under the failed, far-left radical policies, the feckless leadership of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. That was a point made over and over again by JD Vance tonight. Now, we have a mounting crisis at home overseas. Things will only get worse if Kamala Harris gets a promotion. Hey, Sean Hannity here.

We are live. We are in the spin room. We are in New York City. Now, coming up tonight, we're going to get reaction from Senator Ted Cruz, Donald Trump Jr. is here. The vape, Ramaswami, the man of the hour, JD Vance will be coming into the spin room. I think, kind of, wipe the floor with Tim Walls, who seem very nervous all night. Make no mistake. This was a consequential debate. It will, in my view, register in the polls and will boost Donald Trump. You decide. When did Iran and Hamas and their proxies attack Israel? It was during the administration of Kamala Harris. Ask yourself at home. When, when was the last time? I'm 40 years old. When was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict breakout? The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president. Look, we all want to solve it. I, most of us want to solve this. And that is the United States Congress. That's the board of patrol agents. The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris' open border. It is a disgrace to him. And I actually think, I agree with you. I think you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does. You're going to hear a lot from Tim Walls this evening, and you just heard it in the answer. A lot of what Kamala Harris proposes to do. And some of it, I'll be honest with you. It even sounds pretty good. Here's what you won't hear. Is that Kamala Harris has already done it. If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle-class problems, then she ought to do them now. Not one asking for promotion, but in the job the American people gave her three and a half years ago. What Tim Walls is doing, and I honestly, Tim, I think you got a tough job here. Because you've got to play whack-a-mole. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take-home pay, which of course he did. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation, which of course he did. And then you simultaneously got to defend Kamala Harris's atrocious economic record, which has made gas, groceries, and housing unaffordable for American citizens. Now, well, soon to be maybe, Vice President Vance was measured. He was prepared, compassionate, obviously smart, intelligent, bright, showed a lot of compassion. And the country really got to meet JD Vance tonight, not a caricature of the media mob, state-run media mob created of him. And as they do, Donald Trump, meanwhile Tim Wall, he didn't look very comfortable, visibly nervous, constantly making well-kind of weird faces, trying to deliver rehearsed lines. Tim Walls also lied over and over again. We fact-checked him. Lied about taxes, pretended only the wealthy Americans would see a tax hike under the Harris and Walls administration. That's false. He lied about the border, pretending that illegal immigration numbers are lower than under Trump, which is false, totally false. He lied about abortion. He lied about housing. He lied about inflation. 2025, the project that only exists in their mind. He lied about regulations. And when asked about another lie surrounding his time in China, Tim Walls kind of embarrassed himself. This is a moment to watch. Governor Walls, you said you were in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protest in the spring of 1989. But Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are reporting that you actually didn't travel to Asia until August of that year. Can you explain that discrepancy? Yes, I'm going to ask. Well, into the folks out there, I didn't get at the top of this. Look, I grew up in small rural Nebraska, town of 400, town that you rode your bike with your buddy, still the street lights come on, and I'm proud of that service. Now, look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. They look, I will be the first to tell you, I have poured my heart into my community. I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect, and I'm a knucklehead at times. I will say more than anything. Many times I will talk a lot, I will get caught up in the rhetoric. But being there, the impact it made, the difference it made in my life, I learned a lot about China. Governor, just to follow up on that, the question was, can you explain the discrepancy? No, just... All I said on this was is I got there that summer and mispoke on this. So I will just... That's what I've said. Now Tim Walsh clearly in over his head, despite plenty of assistance from the, well, lately by a CBS moderators, Walsh didn't look pretty good, didn't look good in any way tonight. And by the way, CBS, they should frankly be ashamed. They didn't keep to the rules, so-called moderators immediately broke their promise, not to serve as fact checkers, in order to help Tim Walsh, and push their own political views as, quote, facts. Meanwhile, this country and the world are absolutely deteriorating under the failed, far-left radical policies, the feckless leadership of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. That was a point made over and over again by JD Vance tonight. Now, we have a mounting crisis at home overseas. Things will only get worse if Kamala Harris gets a promotion. Hey, Sean Hannity here.

The Five runs down what to expect at the CBS Vice Presidential Debate,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrzSv1eSvCQ,2024-10-01 22:48:24+00:00,JD Vance replaced as Republican VP nominee?,0.611730694770813," We are just hours away from the high stakes vice presidential showdown between JD Vance and Tim Walsh. But watch out, JD. Team Walsh seems to be laying a trap. They're acting all nervous that the governor will blow it and even taking to the airwaves to lower expectations. Watch this. I just think we need to lower expectations a little bit, because then we can all be pleasantly surprised if I'm wrong. And that Tim Walsh just mops the floor with him. Trying to pin him is extreme out of touch and all of that. I think that's where he's going to go really, really hard. If it's joyful warrior versus Rumpi Young Guy trying to represent Rumpi Old Guy, I think it would be a win. And Donald Trump is getting in on the pre-debate fun by taking this shot at Tim Walsh. Watch. You'll see it tomorrow with JD. It'll be stacked. He's going up against a moron, a total moron, how she picked him is unbelievable. And I think it's a big factor. There's something wrong with it, guy. He's sick. OK. Let me ask you this, Jessica. You've got a guy who was a six-term congressman. He's in his second term, misgovernor. He's run for major office nine times. Now he's running for vice president. And they really want a lower expectations as though he's not up. To this? Everybody wants to lower expectations for all their candidates. Donald Trump basically won 2016 because we lowered expectations. He showed up and didn't like vomit on himself. And everyone was like, oh, this will be fine. And then he got to be president. It's a completely normal practice. Donald Trump calling Tim Walsh a moron. And over the weekend, he said that Kamala Harris was born mentally disabled, challenged or disabled. Joe Biden became that, but Kamala was that way from birth. I'm not, you know, I'm not a Pollyanna. I can take it the mean commentary. That does not signify to the American public that you can govern for all Americans or that you're not a little child. So as far as tonight goes, you know, JD Vance has already made history. He's the least popular VP candidate that we've ever had going into this. And Tim Walsh, I understand, will be pressed about what happened during the summer after George Floyd was murdered. But he has a really good record to defend. He won reelection in 2022 by a bigger margin than he won the first time. Minnesota is a six-beth state in the country to do business. He got, got a $3.7 billion surplus. He cut taxes for middle-class Minnesotans. He can talk about all of those things. The foreign policy part will definitely be interesting, especially with Israel at the top of the agenda. And I really want him to press JD Vance on why he voted against the aid package to Israel. This is not the same thing as having Donald Trump up there who says, you know, give Israel whatever they want. JD Vance is an isolationist, someone who voting against aid to Israel, one of our great allies, as well as to Ukraine. You know, Dana, some of the articles have characterized walls as a bit manic. A guy who literally shuts down when he gets most stressed. How's this guy supposed to handle the most difficult job? One of the most difficult in the world, or does he just open the windows and smell the burning rubber? Well, I think because he's only in the CNN interview, the one interview he's done, and the CNN interview he said 700 words total. So I don't think JD Vance needs to win a popularity contest, but I do think that he has to continue to introduce himself to America tonight's his biggest audience. But same for Tim Walls, except for people in Minnesota, nobody really knows who he is. So it's not a popularity contest, but Vance's mission, basically tonight is he's not going to try to necessarily make people like him. He has to take the fight to the Harris policy agenda and hit some of those things that President Trump didn't hit in his debate, so that all the good vibes and the joy can be exposed. One thing that I thought Walls has done that I've never understood is he immediately out of the gate made fun of JD Vance for going to Yale. And for becoming a venture capitalist and he said, no one that I've taught has ever done that. As if JD Vance was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, which we all read the book. Like that's obviously not the case. It was a very strange and weird way to attack JD Vance. So I'm looking forward to tonight. I do think the other thing that's strange is that I think Walls has a more difficult position tonight because like when I was press secretary, if somebody asked me what does George Bush think about this? Like I knew how did I know. Because I probably agreed. Two, I was with him all the time. And three, he never wavered. He didn't change his position. So I always knew what it was. Imagine your Tim Walls tonight and you're thinking, wait, is she for that now or does she, is she against that? Now I can't remember. And he could get caught in something that could be very embarrassing. What do you think about that, Jesse? I'd like to respond to what Jessica said. They've called Donald Trump a Nazi. So many times he got shot. JD Vance also called him a no. And now you're complaining about being called Donald. They're not complaining. I'm saying it's if I said I can take it. I said it's not a smart way to try to win an election. Okay. Well, maybe getting your opponent shot and put him in jail is not a smart idea either. Tonight is a battle for men, Judge Jeanine. Okay. All right. How sexy is that? They're going to be fighting over us because this is really what it's all about. The Democrats have to stop the bleeding with men. And the Republicans need to run up the score with men. And walls is going to come out. He's going to try to act like Tim Allen, but he's really Bernie Sanders. And he's going to have the same exact strategy as Kamala Harris had, which is attack Trump and don't talk about any solutions because he doesn't have any solutions. And just make JD look weird and try to make himself look normal. He cannot make any mistakes. I agree with Dan. Either of them can't make a mistake because this race is so tight. Any ridiculous thing that either one of these guys says about tampons or cats is just going to get blasted out everywhere and that's all everyone's going to talk about. But he does have a challenge because he has to defend himself. The has to defend Kamala and he has to defend Joe Biden. JD Vance has to do what Trump wasn't fully able to do, which is make Harris and walls own the Biden legacy. And the mics are hot. So he can just turn to this guy and say you said Bidenomics was working. How? Or why are we hiring you guys after you're in power now? What you're supposed to fix the problems you created? That's what he should do. And if he's smart, he should attack the media. And since he's such a great storyteller, I'd like to see him say this is where we were. This is where we are now. And this is where we're going to take you. That's what he needs to do. And I think he'll be very effective. You know, Greg, they say that he also has a very short fuse. How does JD tap into that? I don't know. I think you just talk about the issues. But I do agree with Jesse that men don't care about joy. Right? Being gay does not lower the inflation or lower the crime rates. And I use the word gay in its original sense. Happy. Yes. Trump's right. They are stacked against him no matter what happens. Walt will be the winner. The only reason Trump was considered the winner against Biden is that the media couldn't spin Joe Biden's collapse. I do believe that Walt will probably come after Vance over the cats and dogs stuff. And I think Vance could easily just parlay that. Go, you know, you're right. I'm probably better at stuff like crime immigration, inflation, drug addiction, issues of war and service. I'll give you the victory on Cat Redaric. OK? But at least at the very least, my stories came from citizens. They weren't made up. They weren't lies to falsely attribute valor to my past or pad my resume about, you know, going here or going there. And then he just moves from there to immigration. Right? Talk about, you know, why is it that they're all the policies of his party only going one direction? Illegal's in, not out. Sanctuary cities, the asylum laws, the remaining Mexico. These were all designed to get it end result, which is now we have rapists and murderers by the thousands in the United States. If he tries to fact check that, that's very simple. You will say, but that's an accumulation over decades. And he can obviously say, so you're telling me somebody in the 80, from the 1980s or 90s is included in that number. It's obviously weighted towards the present when you look at Venezuela's low crime rate right now. And we have Venezuelan gangs. If it were a consistent number, we would know that, but it's not. So we know that they're talking about the relevant time right now. So I think that's, if he just sticks to the specific policies, not, you know, I think if you're on the fence, and I can't believe anybody's on the fence right now, but if you're on the fence, that's pretty amazing. It gets a preparation age. You're going to, you're probably going to hear like, oh, this is the Democrats are a bunch of extremists. And the right is much, Republicans are screaming, that's that going to wash over you. So you just have to go, what is the consensus between everybody? Low crime, low inflation, a strong border. What more could you want? And you just look at, and you go, but the problem with Waltz is, it's been the wrong side of every one of those. All right.

But he does have a challenge because he has to defend himself. The has to defend Kamala and he has to defend Joe Biden. JD Vance has to do what Trump wasn't fully able to do, which is make Harris and walls own the Biden legacy. And the mics are hot. So he can just turn to this guy and say you said Bidenomics was working. How? Or why are we hiring you guys after you're in power now? What you're supposed to fix the problems you created? That's what he should do. And if he's smart, he should attack the media. And since he's such a great storyteller, I'd like to see him say this is where we were. This is where we are now. And this is where we're going to take you. That's what he needs to do. And I think he'll be very effective. You know, Greg, they say that he also has a very short fuse. How does JD tap into that? I don't know. I think you just talk about the issues. But I do agree with Jesse that men don't care about joy. Right? Being gay does not lower the inflation or lower the crime rates. And I use the word gay in its original sense. Happy. Yes. Trump's right. They are stacked against him no matter what happens. Walt will be the winner. The only reason Trump was considered the winner against Biden is that the media couldn't spin Joe Biden's collapse. I do believe that Walt will probably come after Vance over the cats and dogs stuff. And I think Vance could easily just parlay that. Go, you know, you're right. I'm probably better at stuff like crime immigration, inflation, drug addiction, issues of war and service. I'll give you the victory on Cat Redaric. OK? But at least at the very least, my stories came from citizens. They weren't made up. They weren't lies to falsely attribute valor to my past or pad my resume about, you know, going here or going there. And then he just moves from there to immigration. Right? Talk about, you know, why is it that they're all the policies of his party only going one direction? Illegal's in, not out. Sanctuary cities, the asylum laws, the remaining Mexico. These were all designed to get it end result, which is now we have rapists and murderers by the thousands in the United States. If he tries to fact check that, that's very simple. You will say, but that's an accumulation over decades. And he can obviously say, so you're telling me somebody in the 80, from the 1980s or 90s is included in that number. It's obviously weighted towards the present when you look at Venezuela's low crime rate right now. And we have Venezuelan gangs. If it were a consistent number, we would know that, but it's not. So we know that they're talking about the relevant time right now. So I think that's, if he just sticks to the specific policies, not, you know, I think if you're on the fence, and I can't believe anybody's on the fence right now, but if you're on the fence, that's pretty amazing. It gets a preparation age. You're going to, you're probably going to hear like, oh, this is the Democrats are a bunch of extremists. And the right is much, Republicans are screaming, that's that going to wash over you. So you just have to go, what is the consensus between everybody? Low crime, low inflation, a strong border. What more could you want? And you just look at, and you go, but the problem with Waltz is, it's been the wrong side of every one of those. All right.

Retired general warns Iran's situation is 'much more fragile' than people realize,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tsTBCgejs8,2024-10-01 21:15:00+00:00,Israel military action against Iran by end of 2024?,0.6203211545944214," Let's bring in retired four-star General Jack Kean, former Army Vice Chief of Staff, now chairman of the Institute for the Study of War, and Fox News' senior strategic analyst, General Gooddavvy with us. We have not heard from you yet so far on this breaking news. Tell us your reactions, sir. Well, certainly, around launching 200 missiles against Israel is a significant event in itself, but also providing early warning that that event is taking places is also pretty significant. What's going on with the Iranians here? I believe the Iranians have been back on the heels for some time now. Ever since Hania was killed in their high security zone where many of their senior leaders live, and they promised retaliation, and eight weeks later, I think we're almost in a ninth week, there's finally some retaliation. My Israeli sources, relatively high, told me that Hamas, very frustrated with Iran over this, has a lot of very frustrated that he can get more support out of Iran. And I think the Iranians are calculating they want their proxies to do to work for them. That was the concept from the beginning. But I believe that given the tenuous situation that they have domestically in the country, my sources also tell me it's a much more fragile situation than many people realize. So what's the early warning all about? I think that's what it's all about. Is letting Israel know the attack is coming about, when it's coming to minimize the casualties, so there is not a very effective response back on Iran that would put pressure on that domestic population. And I think that's exactly what we should do, frankly. And I think the United States should make up its mind to take the Houthis off the board. They have shut down the Suez Canal for months. They fired on U.S. Navy warships with anti-ship ballistic missiles, and were still playing defense with these guys. It makes no sense whatsoever. I'm assuming the United States had a role to play tonight in helping Israel, and I certainly very worthy, and we've got enormous capability. And I think the Israelis will probably attack sooner rather than later. So, General, I want to go back to what you just laid out there, because you're suggesting, and correct me if I'm wrong, that Iran is in such a complex position right now, the leadership in Iran, and we've seen the hierarchy chart of which everyone is knocked out, although there's a lot of deputies underneath those people, but that they essentially needed for their own power in their own country to show this display of an enormous missile strike on Israel in order to, in order to sort of let their own people know, look, we're responding to these hits against Nasrallah and Hania. Is that correct? And if that's the case, what does Israel, what do you think Israel does do next? Well, I think they'll calculate that they responded very lightly the last time, just taking down an air defense facility right outside Natanz, which is a nuclear enterprise. They did that internally from the country, and I think they wanted to show a little bit of leg there that they could do something like that, and not have the penetrator Israeli airspace, but at the same time, they weren't doing any real damage. This time, I think they're going to take some action. It likely would be more forceable, more comprehensive, but also you have to keep in mind the main effort at Israeli, Israel is conducting right now is where? It's in Lebanon. They've got a ground incursion going on, and they've got a systematic campaign to take down as many leaders as they can, and as much of the rocket launchers and missiles and other infrastructure that they have there. So that is their main effort, but I do think that they'll seize the opportunity that the Iranians have presented to them. And even though there's no casualties here, I mean, this is a major event. 200 ballistic missiles is significant, and I don't see how the Israelis can ignore that and just go punch back lightly like they did the last time. And I think they're very sensitive to the fact that Iran's leadership is in a much more fragile position with their domestic population. And I think there may be more sensitive to that than the United States is. We share intelligence on assuming both of us are aware of it, but the Israelis are more sensitive to it in terms of wanting to do something about it. The United States, I don't think, wants to do anything about it, to be frank about it. And I want to get to that with you, but it's interesting. I was listening to General Kellogg before, and he was talking about Netanyahu and what he has accomplished, which has been extraordinary. You think about this pager attack, you think about the decapitation of so many of these leaders across the board. And I'm thinking also about Netanyahu at the UN, and he showed one chart called the blessing and one chart called the curse. And the blessing is a future in the Middle East that has the United Arab States and Israel and Saudi Arabia pushing towards a more advanced economic, strong future for the region. And the curse was Iranian leadership. So if Iran is back on its heels, as you say, is this not the moment to take advantage of this and to push them further back and perhaps give the Iranian people a chance at brand new leadership in their country, General? Yeah, well, you put your figure right on it. I don't want to be polyannish about it and say, you know, there's going to be an overtholder regime next week or so. But it takes time. And I think it is time to push back here and certainly develop that situation. What the Israelis have done in Lebanon is absolutely stunning and unprecedented in my frame of reference. I think it's something they've been planning, obviously, for a very long time. And Netanyahu made a commitment to up his game here. He knew full well. The United States wasn't with him. What the United States wants to do is stop. They want to stop all the shooting in Gaza. And in Lebanon, just stop it. Stop it with the Houthis and take the status quo. And the status quo was totally unsatisfactory to the Israelis. Yeah, indeed. We heard President Biden say, stop and keep fire, General Keen. Thank you very much. Hey, Sean Hannity here.

Trey Yingst warns of 'catastrophe in the making' for Americans in Lebanon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46K3xM3kTSQ,2024-10-01 18:00:02+00:00,Will Israel invade Lebanon before November?,0.6063458919525146," our own tray in reporting from HIPAA in Northern Israel. Try. Harris, good afternoon. Overnight, I was with Israeli forces as they entered southern Lebanon going after Hezbollah positions along the border. It was the first time since 2006 that Israel entered into Lebanon on the ground, at least publicly. And the Israelis say they will continue their operations against Hezbollah this morning. They warned civilians in more than 20 different villages and towns to evacuate further north. Another indication that Israeli operations inside Lebanon on the ground are expected to expand. And it comes as tonight this country is bracing for a possible ballistic missile attack by Iran. And maybe even its proxies like Hezbollah or the Houthis in Yemen. We do know that tonight the U.S. Embassy is warning personnel to stay close to shelters. So Israel's second largest city of Tel Aviv urging residents to stay home and close to their mamads, the Hebrew word for shelter. As we look forward here to what is likely to take place, Israel's top spokesman Daniel Hagarri for the military is warning of an imminent missile attack from Iran that would be significant, possibly even larger than the attack that we saw back in April that included around 300 ballistic and cruise missiles along with drones. Right now the region is at a precipice and there are real consultations taking place right now among the defense echelon of Israel about what comes next and what a possible Israeli response would be to a large-scale missile attack from Iran. Remember just last weekend the Israelis took out Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah Iran's largest proxy in the Middle East. And there are concerns today that Iran will directly retaliate for that strike in Beirut over the weekend. Harris? All right, just real quickly because I'm going to run this past you, this is from the State Department now reporting coming into Fox News. The United States is not evacuating Americans from Lebanon at this point. As of right now the U.S. is not getting them out, nor does it have any plans to send evacuation flights to rescue those if they're stranded inside the country as the conflict with Israel intensifies. And this part, tray, latest publicly available data from the State Department shows 86,000 Americans living in Lebanon as of 2022. That's a lot of people to move if you got to do it quickly. How many times do we have to learn this lesson? Like we know that this is the case. I'm glad we're talking about this because it's a really important part of the story. There are tens of thousands of Americans still in Lebanon as this war expands. And there are two questions at hand. One, when will the United States start to refer to this as a war between Israel and Hezbollah? It is erupting and it has erupted for the past year. And now the Israelis are striking the Lebanese capital. They are in southern Lebanon on the ground. But the second question is what are they going to do with the tens of thousands of Americans who will be looking to evacuate Lebanon? We have seen a number of people online talking about the fact that they've reached out to the State Department telling them there are no flights. All the flights are booked. Flights are getting canceled. And the Americans say we will reimburse you for a loan not to actually pay for the flights, but to just offer people a loan for plane tickets that cost thousands of dollars that actually aren't even available at this point. And so it's a major catastrophe in the making. And it's something that the Biden administration is going to have to address as this war develops and the conflict possibly expands even in the next few hours. And Vice President Kamala Harris is on the move all over the country at campaign events. Perhaps she can use that bully pulpit to address it. We'll hold our breath. Treyianks, thank you very much. Great reporting always. Ari, I mean, I always look to see how we left Americans behind. We left them behind in Afghanistan. We knew that this was a problem when Israel first got attacked. A year ago next week, now, October 7, got attacked by the Hamas savages. And we needed to get Americans out of harm's way at that point as Israel went to war. Yet people had the same problem, Kayleigh, and I talked about it. They can't get out. They can't afford to take these flights. Oh, we were slow in sending boats and things to go get them. Come on. My hunch is what's driving a lot of this is faith in Israel by the United States government and military that they believe this is a limited excursion into southern Lebanon, where Israel will not get closer to the American population, which is more based around Beirut and other northern locations, and precise bombing abilities of Israel to hit the military targets without going after other civilian neighborhoods. That is likely what is happening here. I think otherwise, I think, the United States would have tried to evacuate Americans, but what about the Americans in Israel? Similar thinking. They believe that they're safe there because of Israel's military defensive capabilities. Otherwise, you'd have even more Americans to evacuate from the state of Israel. Look, I was told by a military authority who in a position to know after the Iranian attack earlier with their 300 missiles that Iran didn't use their best missiles against Israel. They used some of their older technology. If that's the case, and Iran has more sophisticated weaponry and they do specifically missiles, this will be a test for Israel's defense system and America's defense system. I suspect strongly Israel and America are up to the test. Two things. We are in kind of a different generation now where they like to take people, hostages. So I am concerned about Americans on the ground, not because Israel can't fight tremendously well, but because Hezbollah is dirty in their terrorists. And I don't want anybody being taken. The second is that arrow system that handles those higher altitude weapons. Congressman Mass was telling me about this last hour, Kayleigh. They may have to use something more than just the iron dome for the very reason that Ari just mentioned. They Iran likely has some things we haven't seen yet. They do. And Israel, unfortunately, yes, they have the support of the United States. Yes, they have the support of the Western world, but it's not the full support of the United States. We should be unequivocally standing with Israel, not saying ceasefire, standing with Israel. Because to your point, we are not even at the one-year anniversary of October 7th. More than a thousand citizens ripped from their home. I'll never forget Sheri Bebis holding her two little boys with their little red heads, Kefir Bebis, Ariel Bebis, who we don't know where they are, first birthday in captivity. Okay? And then when you look at Northern Israel and you look over the border at Hezbollah, they were planning another October 7th style attack. And for our country to say ceasefire now, no. Defend your borders, protect yourselves, stand with this country. My gosh, as Iran is looking to target them, because guess what? Iran is going to target you next. They are not stopping until there's a commander in chief who has Middle East peace deals, who assassinate their top general. Oh, wait, we had that. That was Donald Trump with Soleimani. They will not stop. We have a president at a very scary time in our country's history and our world. And I don't know what he's doing right now, other than saying ceasefire. Well, we don't know what the vice president would do and she wants his job. Like, I don't even know what her full policy is on this. And she's too shy to say, really, full-throatedly, as you pointed out, how much she supports Israel, because she's got to get that uncommitted crowd of voters in Minnesota and Michigan and other places, Sheri. Well, I mean, look, I'm going to say, I'm going to quote the Wall Street Journal editorial board when it comes to now, was the moment for this country and our ally Israel. Not only to stand with our ally Israel, but also the response for the U.S. and Europe, build on Israel's military breakthrough and put more pressure on Iran and its proxy network. One thing that Iran does not want to lose right now, that's $40 billion. An annual revenue that they get from oil exports. Right now, oil supply has just spiked on all of these reports in the last hour. Oil is up 4 percent and de-fect the defense stocks are up. Northrop Grumman, for example. What's putting pressure on that, making that happen? Because we know that this is our ally, and we have already heard from a White House official that said that we are going to stand with our ally. That is a military, we're sending more troops to the Middle East. All of that means more might empower the U.S. military. That is the defense stock story, but the Iran story. Watch out. I don't think that they want to jeopardize their exports right now, because that's the money. That's my opinion. Right. And we've seen that, I think, reflected, frankly, in the population versus sort of the old guard, which is that the Middle East wants to move forward. The Middle East wants to recognize the state of Israel from a business perspective. We've talked about this extensively, frankly, that the view of the totally anti-Semitic approach to the extermination of Israel and new Jewish people, that fanatical viewpoint is not shared by our allies in the region, which is why it's so much more incumbent upon the current administration to be vociferous in their support and say, no, we stand unequivocally with Israel. I remember just last week, the United States and France proposed a ceasefire solution that of course, Netanyahu, resoundly rejected. We know this is on the heels, however, of us sending more troops to the region on Monday. We have the fighter-strike carrier group. We have the amphibious groups. We have a lot of stuff happening in the Middle East. So when the Islamic Republic says that they're going to now have this imminent attack, I wonder what will get the attention of our administration, because thus far, Israel has decimated the leadership of Hezbollah. Israel has done everything, no thanks to any type of tepid support on our part. Well, we don't know, again, Biden Harris, Biden tried to, you know, to simply keep it to the storm yesterday at that news conference. Questions came on this. He couldn't answer. He wouldn't answer. He walked out. Kamala Harris just simply skips it. Like, I don't really know what her foreign policy looks like, because she hasn't shown us. And I did go to that website. It is lean. It's like really lean. Hey, everyone. I'm Emily Camponio. Catch me and my co-host, Harris Balkner and Kaylee Meccaneni, on Outnumbered every weekday at 12 p.m. Eastern, or sets your DVR.

"Potential terror attack near Tel Aviv, multiple people injured in shooting",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlmnUgXA0SU,2024-10-01 16:37:45+00:00,Israel x Hezbollah Ceasefire in 2024?,0.6077907681465149," Well, we have breaking news. We go to trade in and high fah israel with latest trade. Yeah, good afternoon guys. We have some breaking news out of Israel near to the city of Tel Aviv and jaffa that sits just to the south of Israel's second largest city. There has been a terror attack. Multiple people shot. First responders are currently on the scene and initial reports indicate that there were two gunmen involved. We're gathering more information about this shooting attack in real time. But I can tell you that the location it took place is a very populated popular area next to cafes and restaurants. And there are video circulating online that we will not show here on television that appear to show many bodies next to a light rail station. This is a station that was actually newly built in an area where many young people in jaffa and Tel Aviv like to hang out quite close to the beach. And an indication that the security situation right now across Israel continues to deteriorate as the country is not only bracing for possible ballistic missile attack from Iran earlier today. People heading to shelters after a rocket attack coming from Lebanon, the Iran back group has below there. And now this developing news out of jaffa just south of Tel Aviv of a shooting attack reported with up to 10 victims currently being treated on the scene. You know, Trey, as I listen to you speak, I just finished watching an 11 minute video from General Hagarri, the spokesperson from IDF. And he gave new information that I wasn't aware of, that Hezbollah was a planning in October 7th like attack before this limited-scale invasion that is that Israel did into Lebanon. And he actually had a name for it. It was called Operation Conquer the Galilee and they uncovered this plan. And then when they went into Lebanon, they found tunnels under children's bed. I know this is very early in this attack, but any indication as to who these militants are, it comes in the backdrop of a lot of new information that we got from Israel overnight. So this shooting attack that is developing right now in jaffa near Tel Aviv, could have been committed by anyone. In the past, when we've seen similar terror attacks taking place in Tel Aviv, the economic capital of Israel, the salons have come from places like the West Bank from East Jerusalem, sometimes from jaffa. And so there's no indication this is directly linked to the situation inside Gaza or in Lebanon. But I do want to just read you this statement because again, this is a developing situation that is coming in right now. A police spokesman sending this message saying a report was received a short time ago regarding a shooting incident in Tel Aviv. There are multiple casualties. Initial suspicion of motive is terror details to follow. And again, the initial reports from Israeli media right now indicate there could be up to 10 victims and possibly even two gunmen. Again, the shooting attack taking place in a very popular area just south of Tel Aviv at a newly built light rail station next to restaurants in cafes. It's actually just about five minutes from where my apartment is and I often run along this area. It gives you a sense of just the security situation on the ground and how unpredictable it is. And it also comes just minutes after rear admiral Daniel Hagarri issued a directive to the residents of Tel Aviv to remain close to shelters because they are fearing a ballistic missile attack that could come from Iran at any moment. I've been covering this story for more than six years and I can tell you this moment today in particular is some of the most extensive breaking news developments out of the Middle East that I've ever witnessed on the ground. The country is preparing for the possibility of the situation unraveling even further nearly a year into this conflict following the October 7th massacre. The Israelis are currently fighting on seven different fronts. The war continues inside Gaza as we saw last night during our embed with the Israeli Commando unit in southern Lebanon. They are fighting Hezbollah there. They are preparing for the possibility of an attack from Iran. We have seen efforts to attack Israel by Iran back Iraqi and Syrian Shia militias. You have Hamas and Islamic jihad cells in the West Bank. And then the Houthi rebels in Yemen that are backed by Iran that this week launched a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv. And so the situation is truly unprecedented. And when you talk about the level of security preparedness for this country, the air defense systems are on high alert, but U.S. officials and Israeli officials fear that may not be enough tonight. And that is part of the reason they are warning civilians to stay close to shelters. Treyetz Emily, notwithstanding those seven fronts, Israel is currently fighting on and anticipating, was there a call to action by the decimated Hezbollah to inspire these terror attacks. Were there a call to action that is leaving Israel now attempting to defend on these random and horrifying terror attacks? As we're seeing, you are right, devastating footage of those bodies there by the train station. I want to take you back almost a year and the early days following the October 7th massacre and the statements that came out from Hamas's political wing and also their military wing, the Al-Khlusam Brigades. And they were encouraging people across the Arab world to take action on their own, to launch lone wolf attacks against Israel, against Jews around the world. And it's the reason that the security state, not just here, but also at Israeli embassies around the world has been so high. As for the current conflict that's developing between Israel and Hezbollah, we heard similar calls from Hezbollah leadership, despite the fact that many of them have been taken out in Israeli strikes over the past two weeks, the sentiment is still there. And one thing that the Israelis haven't seen develop over the past year, and it was always a fear, according to the Defense Minister, when I would meet with him and other top Israeli security officials, was that we would start to see more terror attacks unfolding across Israel. And these could be sourced anywhere from East Jerusalem, they could come from the West Bank, even from Jaffa. And what we are witnessing unfolding tonight, and I do want to just look at my phone here for some updates as they're coming in. The local MDA, the red cross of Israel is saying there's no indication that the gunmen were neutralized. And so this is an ongoing situation that's unfolding, apparently, according to initial reports, that they were not neutralized at the scene. And so this is an ongoing story developing just south of Tel Aviv. Yeah, you know, Trey, the great connection now, the internet. I'm seeing some of what I think you're looking at, too, because there were early reports when the video was dropping even before what was happened in any details. And the Israeli police have now just confirmed the shooting attack as you reported about a minute or so ago. They're talking about the number of casualties, that sort of thing. But it was reported that one of the terrorists was neutralized. And now we are saying that that may not be the case, or the possibility that there were more than two. Whatever the situation is, they're on high alert there. And if they were going to get in those storm bunkers, excuse me, storm. Forgive me. War bunkers now might be the time to do that. If they can't find these people, I mean, this is now what would happen above ground next to the new war zone between Lebanon and Israel, they're fighting terrorists. And terrorists are going to do what they do. They're going to blow stuff up and shoot a lot of people. So what is the talk there on the ground now about taking cover even faster? Well, I want to give you just a little bit of tick talk of how these situations unfold, because we've responded to so many of these attacks over the years reporting here on the ground. And I remember just last year there was a ramming attack in Tel Aviv and a European tourist was killed. A number of other people were injured. And we arrived at the scene as the car was still there on the tyrant. Tel Aviv's version of a boardwalk where people go for runs actually very close to where this attack unfolded tonight. And police not only investigate at the scene, but they worked very quickly to try and gather information about where the attacker came from, because the concern is that they may not be acting alone and that they could be affiliated with other groups like Hamas or Islamic jihad. And if they're conducting a shooting attack against civilians in Tel Aviv or in jaffa, they could also be trying to conduct an idea attack or a suicide bombing as we saw earlier this year. You might remember earlier in the year there was an attempted suicide attack in Tel Aviv and the attacker detonated early. But it just gives you a sense of how fluid the situation is on the ground. And when you speak with Israeli defense officials and security officials in Tel Aviv, they always tell you the same thing. They say if the public knew how many of these attacks that we've thwarted before they happened, people would never leave their homes because there are so many attempts. But the intelligence is so high that they often will stop them before they begin. But again, as we are following this developing story, and I do want to just read you the updates here. I'm getting on my phone. There's one police source texting me and also our internal updates going in. There are four of the wounded are in critical condition according to first responders on the scene. And we do expect to get new numbers on if there are any confirmed fatalities following the shooting attack. But we did see that video and there were certainly people there on the ground that were not moving just a horrific scene just south of Tel Aviv, Israel's second largest city. You know, Trey, authorities were able to say rather quickly that this was a tear incident they believe. I imagine part of that might have to do with timing. They were anticipating an attack from Iran. We just covered that within the next 12 to 24 hours. And then also the location. I mean, this is Jaffa. This is you mentioned just minutes from your apartment. This happened. There's a lot of young people here. This is a different setting than the Caboteses in southern Israel. This seems like something intended to create psychological horror for the people of Israel. Yeah, and not to get to into the weeds about the map here, but the map breakdown is important while we're covering this story. Jaffa is a prime example of coexistence of how Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side and they can go to the same restaurants and they can have homeless and they can go to the beach together and not be at war. And there is often a tension that erupts in Jaffa when the security situation is high across the region, but very rarely do attacks unfold there like we are watching unfold tonight. And very rarely is it the focal point of tension across the region. That's often reserved for Jerusalem and places like the Gaza border as we've seen in the past and of course during the October 7th massacre. And again, I just want to read you these updates as they're coming in. These are initial reports according to first responders on the scene, but initial reports indicate that two attackers in Jaffa open fire at people at the new light rail train in the Tel Aviv Jaffa area, photos of the attackers with M16s, and there are also some initial and I'm just going to look at this image as I'm talking to you here and I'm going to describe it to you. And I know exactly the store that they're walking out of. There's a store that these two gunmen are walking out of and they appear to be caught on security camera and in front of them there is someone laying next to a trash can not moving. This is a very active area and again, this is a new light rail that was just recently completed. The light rail has stops all throughout Tel Aviv. You can go from the heart of Tel Aviv to Jaffa if you want to go to the beach there. It's a place where there are many young people with cafes and restaurants. It is not close to any of the security installations in Tel Aviv. It's on the other end of the city from the Kiria Israel's version of the Pentagon. It's not near any of the high tech buildings. It's a very quiet area where people will go to basically relax on the weekend or spend an evening. So to have an attack unfold at this location, the attackers likely knew that this was a soft target. And I can also tell you one other detail about this part of the city. It's actually very close to a police station just down the road. And so the initial video that we are seeing shows some police on mopeds responding to the scene and indication that even if they were able to get there quickly, they weren't able to be there at that very moment, of course, and as a result and more images coming in just now confirming that there were indeed two gunmen conducting this attack in Tel Aviv. Well, at least two. I mean, as I pointed out, the early reports and some of them are still continuing that one person has been neutralized. We'll see as it all shakes out, I want to be really sensitive to the details that you and I are both gathering from other journalists around the world. And from these two on the screen, what we can glean from photographs, I want to be really clear. We're seeing a lot of unconfirmed, at least we can't independently confirm these pictures. But what we are seeing are those two that people are describing on the ground inside Jaffa, which, you know, technically it's so close, it's Tel Aviv. And there is one. And Kaylee and I pulled it up on different devices and different sources at different times showing two men. And again, it could be more than two. We don't know. They are very close to the subject that they are firing on. I mean, we're talking about an unsurvivability situation here. And they are- Guys, if I could just enter- No, nothing else can get hit in this photo. Go ahead, Trey. Jerusalem. There are initial reports of siren sounding near Jerusalem. And just to give you another update on the security situation as it unfolds here, I do want to just look at my phone here. There are a few people texting two sources at the same time, one moment here. Yeah, so this gives you a sense of just how things are unraveling here. Yeah. You have this situation that is unfolding on the ground just south of Tel Aviv as security forces. And here it comes right now. There are rocket sirens. We don't know where they're coming from, but I'm going to be- I'm going to be very careful with this information, but I- I'm going to just read out what is happening in real time. Right now, rocket alerts are sounding on the eastern side of Israel. And one of the alerts is next to the Dead Sea hotels. We don't know where this attack is coming from. In previous Iranian attacks, sirens were sounding in these locations. Again, I want to be very careful. We do not know if this is the attack from Iran, but the fact that sirens are sounding in this area indicates that there are- and also near Dhammona, which is close to the nuclear facility in the desert. In the past, these- these areas have been targeted by the Iranians when they launched that attack in April. We do not know if this is the attack from Iran, but in a matter of probably two or three minutes, I can give you an answer on that. It gives you a sense of just how quickly things are developing here on the ground. Riradmal, Daniel Hagar, that top spokesman for the Israeli military warning earlier this evening, just about 30 minutes ago of an imminent missile attack. This could be coming from- from further east, or it could be coming from the north. There's no way to know in real time."
Iran reportedly moving missiles for attack on Israel,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ojunOoa5Y,2024-10-01 16:00:02+00:00,Israel x Hezbollah Ceasefire in 2024?,0.6149237155914307," Well, this is right now what it looks like in Beirut, Lebanon, where Israel is continuing to pound that area. We just saw live images of the aftermath of Israeli air strike continuing to take out Hezbollah terror targets. Tensions are reaching, well, the point of retaliation now in the Middle East. This is what we were wanting to avoid. A senior White House official tells Fox, Iran is planning an imminent missile attack on Israel. The Israeli defense force pushing forward with a new phase now in its war on Hezbollah. Yesterday, of course, it moved in on the ground, the IDF, and called it limited ground operations inside southern Lebanon going after Iran's proxy terrorists, those people they prop up with their money. Hezbollah plan to launch their October 7 attack from villages across southern Lebanon, where they have been building up their arms, capabilities and forces for the last two decades. Our soldiers entered Hezbollah's underground infrastructures, exposed Hezbollah's hidden weapon caches and seized and destroyed the weapons, including advanced Iranian-made weapons. The Israeli air strikes have taken out nearly all of Hezbollah's command in recent weeks, including their big leader, Nasrallah, just this week. Hassan Nasrallah was hit inside the nation's capital, precision by Israel. Nate Foy is in Tel Aviv. Nate, before you take it away, I have a quick question. In terms of this imminent, can you see or do you know what's happening on the other side of the border and leaven on it at this point? I mean, does it look like people are moving out of the way there, too? I'm just curious to know, because that'll tell us potentially how fast Iran is going to hit Israel. Well, the ground incursion, as you know, Harris is underway, but I can actually tell you an exact number. It takes 12 minutes for a ballistic missile to travel from Iran to where we are in Israel right now. So, it's a waiting game. And as you mentioned, according to a U.S. official, Iran has been noticed moving its missiles in recent days. And we're expecting this attack to play out in the next 24 hours. What we don't know, Harris, is the exact scale of it. The only reference point that we have is the only direct attack on Israel that Iran has launched, which they did back in April after Israel attacked in Iranian consulate in Damascus. And that attack, Iran launched over 300 ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and drones. But as you mentioned in your intro, this time it's different, because just days ago, Israel took out Hassan Nasrella, the leader of Hezbollah for 32 years. And just hours ago, Israel launched a ground offensive in Lebanon threatening one of Iran's biggest proxies. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had this message for the people of Israel moments ago. We will stand steadfast in the trying days ahead of us. Together we will stand, together we will fight, and together we will win. And take a look at this, Harris. Tel Aviv got hit by Hezbollah rockets this morning. They targeted the Masad headquarters here. The IDF says two drivers got hurt by falling shrapnel. And we're also learning today that Israeli special units infiltrated southern Lebanon dozens of times throughout the conflict before launching its limited offensive last night. The IDF identified and dismantled the tunnel network, gathered intelligence, and hampered Hezbollah's capabilities during covert operations. Right now as we anticipate this pending attack, Harris, there are thousands of additional U.S. troops in the region, including fighter jet squadrons that will defend Israel from this attack. And the U.S. also says that if Iran directly attacks Israel, there will be severe consequences for Iran. We'll send it back to you. There is so much going on every time I see a report with you. Thank you, Nate Boy. For getting the conversation started on this. You got it. Florida Congressman Brian Masnell, let's dig into what was just reported. The Congressman served as a volunteer in the Israeli Defense Forces and he sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and he served for our nation, valiantly as well too. It is great to see you today. Let's dig in. I asked the question about what it looks like on the Lebanese Israeli border. And the reason I asked that question is, if you know that there is a ground-incursion coming, you'll move some people out of the way I get that. But if you know Iran is going to then come from another direction and join that, you'll move everybody. Is that even a potential? I mean, would Iran do more than just hit Israel by air? Look, I think what Iran has to assess in the response that they get is probably twofold. One has Israel totally degraded their ability to do a short range attack by what they did on that Lebanon border. Had they eliminated those capabilities of rockets, of drones, of things in the short way? And so are they left with only the option of doing something from a longer range? And then they have to assess. Because remember, they're not dealing exactly with U.S. military grade equipment in the same generation that we talk about our generations of equipment. They're not in the same ballpark. They're not in the same game. So what can they do against the other systems of defense that are there beyond the iron dome system that gets spoken about so much? The arrow system, the tactical high altitude area defense systems, the David Sling systems, these other systems. What do they think they can do against other systems of defense? And that's something that they have to calculate. So you were part of the idea. And I know viewers may wonder, well, how did that come about? And what can you tell us about those fighting forces? Well, this goes back to what was going on in higher education years ago as a student at Harvard back in 2014. There were constant protests against Israel at that time. And I decided one day after having a very negative encounter with some Palestinian supporters that I was going to go and show my support for Israel. And I did. I went and volunteered alongside their military there, which was a great experience. But what I can tell you about the difference in those forces is they realize on a daily basis that they are surrounded by enemies directly on their border, whether it be the tunnels that come through Egypt, whether it be what comes across from Gaza, or whether it be what comes from the North in Lebanon. They have a daily reminder of the enemies on their border. And it's just a matter of maybe 40, 50 miles for them to cut the country in half in many of these places. That's the reality for the fighters on the ground. Congress and Mass, do you believe that there was any sort of coordination between Hezbollah and Hamas on October 7th? Hezbollah began to hit Israel very hard with more missiles on October 8th after that 7th attack. Do you think there was any coordination between those two groups? I absolutely believe that there was coordination. And that Israel was wise to not take the bait. Israel has been bombarded by Hezbollah for the last year, moving people out of the north of Israel, because so many people have been attacked, the, you know, many refugees. I guess you could call them at this point. They wanted to focus on what was going on in Gaza. They are now moving on to addressing what has been taking place for this last year, coming from the Lebanon border coming into Israel. And this had to happen. And in this, I think everybody needs to ask themselves a question as they ask, well, this is going to escalate. This is going to lead to something bigger. If this was the United States of America and Canada were lobbying rockets into Michigan or the cartels on the southern border, were lobbying them into California or Arizona or someone else. None of us would be asking if it's going to escalate. We would only be asking what capabilities we need to destroy that enemy. Well, the cartels are an enemy. And they don't use bombs. They use fentanyl and sex trafficking and attacking and menacing children. They're cowards. So, yeah, I guess that's our first war down there. Last quick question. What type of movement now are you looking at to say what Iran is going to do next? You know, I think for them, are they moving any forces that they have remaining off of the border again, recognizing the difference in generations of weaponry that they have? Israel has to look at, okay, did they only have capability to fire something that they had eyes on or lasers on or, okay, this is going into details of different generations of technology, but those have to be things that Israel are looking for. Congressman Massid is always great to have you and focus. Thank you for your service and your expertise. Thank you, Harris. Hey, everyone. I'm Emily Camponio.

Hezbollah targets Israel's Mossad headquarters with rocket fire,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls,2024-10-01 12:15:02+00:00,Israel x Hezbollah Ceasefire in 2024?,0.6925228834152222," We have got a Fox News alert for you because right now, Israeli troops are moving deeper into southern Lebanon after beginning their overnight invasion on the ground. Nate Floyd joins us right now from Tel Aviv. Nate. Hey Steve, good morning. So Israel is complementing its limited ground offensive with additional airstrikes across Lebanon this morning while Hezbollah is responding with a constant wave of rockets into northern and central Israel, including here in Tel Aviv where Hezbollah targeted the Masad headquarters with several rockets fired from a civilian area in Lebanon. Some, but not all of them were shot down. Take a look at the damage. We're learning of two injuries. Both of them drivers hit by falling shrapnel. This is the second time in a week that Hezbollah has targeted Tel Aviv, the Houthis targeted Tel Aviv twice as well in the past week. So four times overall. Take a look here at Israeli forces getting ready to invade southern Lebanon overnight. Their commandos and paratroopers are focused on Hezbollah positions up against the border. So the evacuated residents of Israel's north can return to their homes. Now Israel continues taking out Hezbollah's weapons capabilities as well. They hit several facilities in the Dahia neighborhood of Beirut this morning. And don't forget, Israel is still fighting Hamas in Gaza. Her night Israeli airstrikes reportedly killed at least 31 people. In one of them, Israel says they hit a Hamas command center that was inside a building that used to be a school. Meanwhile, Yemen's Houthi rebels appear to have resumed their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea after Israel hit Yemen's port city of Hadeh on Sunday. The Houthis also claim they shot down a U.S. drone on Monday. As for what we can expect in this limited ground invasion, a senior U.S. official tells Fox that it will be smaller and quicker than the 2006 Second Lebanon war that lasted 34 days and ended in a UN resolution requiring that Hezbollah operate north of the Latani River, which is something that didn't actually happen in practice. And that's why the 60,000 residents up in Israel's north had to evacuate when Hezbollah began firing on Israel on October 8th. Brian? Wow Nate, so many moving parts. Great job. 28 minutes down before the top there. Let's expand on the conversation. We're IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conriquek has joined us now. He is live in Jerusalem with the latest colonel. The best you can. I know you know where the leaders are. I know you knew where Nasrallah was. How well does the IDF know the tunnel system they're going into right now? Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for having me. I think that Hezbollah has been busy over the last 17, 18 years digging tunnels and preparing for this day. And what exists just on the other side of the blue line, the border between Israel and Lebanon is an intricate system of tunnels that Hezbollah has dug, which they intend to use in order to cross into Israel and attack Israeli communities. And that will be one very important point of infrastructure that Israeli troops will be going in in order to dismantle so that the area will be safe for Israeli civilians to return to once the military operations hopefully will come to a successful conclusion. Between the 3000 plus leaders, Hezbollah fighters, they were blown up with their pages and walking talkies. Between the leadership that was blown up, between Nasrallah's death, what is the level of disarray among the world's leading terrorist organization right now? Ten being total disarray, one being no big deal. I would put that at a four, maybe a five. We're talking about a serious terrorist organization of battle-hardened war criminals. They fought and conducted lots of war crimes in Syria at the behest of Bashar al-Assad and they've been fighting in Lebanon. They have experienced fighting against Israel. So despite the fact that a lot of the senior leadership of Hezbollah has been decimated, they're still rank and file and junior and mid-level leadership. And I think that they are battle ready and they want to fight and that's what the idea is going in to deal with. Colonel Lowell's Tree Journal tells a story today that the U.S. better get aboard. We have an opportunity now to neutralize the Houthi rebels as well as Iran. Here's what the headline, how to exploit Israel's success with Hezbollah, we can Iran worried. Now is the time for the U.S. to add pressure. Do you agree? How would you do it? Well, I think that Israel is fighting a war for the West on behalf of the West. Many times an ungrateful war where Israel isn't getting the support that it really needs and many times gets far more criticism than it should in the West, not necessarily in the U.S. but in many other countries. What I think is what is doing is trailblazing and showing the world that yes, you can fight, you can stand up against militant Islamism and yes, you can stand up against Iran and their terrorist organizations. And I think that it's very good that we're talking about the Islamic Republic of Iran because they are the source of violence and instability. They are the ones that are threatening U.S. troops in the Middle East. They are the ones who are attacking Israeli civilians day and night. And I think that in the not so distant future, that is where Israeli focus will go. We have some other fish to fry to deal with first, Hamas and Khizbalah, but the day isn't far when we will turn our focus on Iran and deal with the source of violence and instability in the Middle East. Thanks so much. So, Teneh Kurnal, it's everyone's pretty much in awe of what Israel has done. Walter Russell Mead of the Wall Street Journal says Prime Minister Netanyahu has had the greatest week. It may be modern political history and military history, too. Thanks so much, Kurnal. Great to see you. I'm Steve Lucy. Try and kill me. And I mean to hear you.

They are the ones that are threatening U.S. troops in the Middle East. They are the ones who are attacking Israeli civilians day and night. And I think that in the not so distant future, that is where Israeli focus will go. We have some other fish to fry to deal with first, Hamas and Khizbalah, but the day isn't far when we will turn our focus on Iran and deal with the source of violence and instability in the Middle East. Thanks so much. So, Teneh Kurnal, it's everyone's pretty much in awe of what Israel has done. Walter Russell Mead of the Wall Street Journal says Prime Minister Netanyahu has had the greatest week.

Hezbollah targets Israel's Mossad headquarters with rocket fire,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdE3qZXYIls,2024-10-01 12:15:02+00:00,Will Israel invade Lebanon before November?,0.6504033803939819," We have got a Fox News alert for you because right now, Israeli troops are moving deeper into southern Lebanon after beginning their overnight invasion on the ground. Nate Floyd joins us right now from Tel Aviv. Nate. Hey Steve, good morning. So Israel is complementing its limited ground offensive with additional airstrikes across Lebanon this morning while Hezbollah is responding with a constant wave of rockets into northern and central Israel, including here in Tel Aviv where Hezbollah targeted the Masad headquarters with several rockets fired from a civilian area in Lebanon. Some, but not all of them were shot down. Take a look at the damage. We're learning of two injuries. Both of them drivers hit by falling shrapnel. This is the second time in a week that Hezbollah has targeted Tel Aviv, the Houthis targeted Tel Aviv twice as well in the past week. So four times overall. Take a look here at Israeli forces getting ready to invade southern Lebanon overnight. Their commandos and paratroopers are focused on Hezbollah positions up against the border. So the evacuated residents of Israel's north can return to their homes. Now Israel continues taking out Hezbollah's weapons capabilities as well. They hit several facilities in the Dahia neighborhood of Beirut this morning. And don't forget, Israel is still fighting Hamas in Gaza. Her night Israeli airstrikes reportedly killed at least 31 people. In one of them, Israel says they hit a Hamas command center that was inside a building that used to be a school. Meanwhile, Yemen's Houthi rebels appear to have resumed their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea after Israel hit Yemen's port city of Hadeh on Sunday. The Houthis also claim they shot down a U.S. drone on Monday. As for what we can expect in this limited ground invasion, a senior U.S. official tells Fox that it will be smaller and quicker than the 2006 Second Lebanon war that lasted 34 days and ended in a UN resolution requiring that Hezbollah operate north of the Latani River, which is something that didn't actually happen in practice. And that's why the 60,000 residents up in Israel's north had to evacuate when Hezbollah began firing on Israel on October 8th. Brian? Wow Nate, so many moving parts. Great job. 28 minutes down before the top there. Let's expand on the conversation. We're IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conriquek has joined us now. He is live in Jerusalem with the latest colonel. The best you can. I know you know where the leaders are. I know you knew where Nasrallah was. How well does the IDF know the tunnel system they're going into right now? Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for having me. I think that Hezbollah has been busy over the last 17, 18 years digging tunnels and preparing for this day. And what exists just on the other side of the blue line, the border between Israel and Lebanon is an intricate system of tunnels that Hezbollah has dug, which they intend to use in order to cross into Israel and attack Israeli communities. And that will be one very important point of infrastructure that Israeli troops will be going in in order to dismantle so that the area will be safe for Israeli civilians to return to once the military operations hopefully will come to a successful conclusion. Between the 3000 plus leaders, Hezbollah fighters, they were blown up with their pages and walking talkies. Between the leadership that was blown up, between Nasrallah's death, what is the level of disarray among the world's leading terrorist organization right now? Ten being total disarray, one being no big deal. I would put that at a four, maybe a five. We're talking about a serious terrorist organization of battle-hardened war criminals. They fought and conducted lots of war crimes in Syria at the behest of Bashar al-Assad and they've been fighting in Lebanon. They have experienced fighting against Israel. So despite the fact that a lot of the senior leadership of Hezbollah has been decimated, they're still rank and file and junior and mid-level leadership. And I think that they are battle ready and they want to fight and that's what the idea is going in to deal with. Colonel Lowell's Tree Journal tells a story today that the U.S. better get aboard. We have an opportunity now to neutralize the Houthi rebels as well as Iran. Here's what the headline, how to exploit Israel's success with Hezbollah, we can Iran worried. Now is the time for the U.S. to add pressure. Do you agree? How would you do it? Well, I think that Israel is fighting a war for the West on behalf of the West. Many times an ungrateful war where Israel isn't getting the support that it really needs and many times gets far more criticism than it should in the West, not necessarily in the U.S. but in many other countries. What I think is what is doing is trailblazing and showing the world that yes, you can fight, you can stand up against militant Islamism and yes, you can stand up against Iran and their terrorist organizations. And I think that it's very good that we're talking about the Islamic Republic of Iran because they are the source of violence and instability.

Gen. Keane: This is 'appalling' from the Biden admin.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsdq-xZl83s,2024-10-01 05:30:16+00:00,Israel military action against Iran by end of 2024?,0.6144148111343384," So there's an extraordinary reading over the weekend and into the week now. Israel went on offense, wiping out the entire leadership of Hezbollah. They've been in charge there, and Esra'ala has for 32 years. Jack Keynes with us now, Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst and Sergin Morning to You. What's your best guess, General? What comes next, and what are you watching for? Well, first of all, right before our eyes, we can see there's a strategic shift that's taking place. You know, on October the 7th, so on because of that surprise devastating attack, 1200 killed, 250 hostages, so many of the people in Israel lost confidence in their security forces, their military, as a result of it, because they thought they would always be protected. And what has happened here with Israel destroying close to the five brigades that have been in Gaza, still more work to be done there. I don't want to minimize, there's still some challenges there. But now, as you point out, taking out the entire leadership structure of Hezbollah, I mean, an intelligent penetration that is quite unprecedented, and there's a shift that's taking place. Certainly, the people of Israel are returning confidence in their security forces. But more than that, the adversaries in the region are seeing Israel's complete capability. They're intelligence service, they're technology dominance that they have over an adversary, and also the air-powered dominance that they have. I have believed for some time now, eight weeks since Anaya was killed in a high security zone inside of Tehran, the political chief of Hamas, and Iran has done nothing about it, yet it has promised to do something. And here we are, and I think they're back on their heels as a result of what Israel is doing. That's what I'm talking about, deterrence. The hands-off policy from the Biden administration, dealing with Iran, I think, is dead wrong. And hopefully they'll back Israel to the fullest air and give them some assistance. I truly believe Iran probably has to do something to save face of Bill and Dana. But I don't believe they want to go to war. They know they can't handle it with Israel, and they know the United States would be on the side of Israel in that fight, and they risk losing their entire regime as a result of it. The Israelis have reminded the West what it's like to feel when you are on offense against radical Islamic terrorism. And Eli Lake says this in the Free Press that there are now strategic opportunities to go after Iran's nuclear program. If Harris and Biden were wise, they would shelve their strategy of endless ceasefire talks and instead embrace Israel's escalation, because the best way to end a regional war is to win it. I've been thinking about Iran's nuclear capabilities, and with Hezbollah, their arm in Lebanon really decapitated at this point until they can rebuild if they even can do that. What about Iran's, how close are they to a nuclear weapon and could that be pushed back? You know, a couple of things. Certainly Hezbollah, dramatic loss of leadership, will obviously set this organization back, but they have tens of thousands of fighters and tens of thousands of rockets and missiles. So that's still a formidable force. Israel does not want to conduct a ground campaign. What they want is Hezbollah to remove their forces so they can put their people back into their homes in northern Israel. In other words, voluntarily do that. That's what the stepped up campaign and this aggressiveness that we've seen for two weeks has been all about. They get inside their head to pull their forces back. If they don't do that, then they will go in there. Prime Minister Netanyahu has promised us that. Where the Biden administration is, I think, they just wanted to stop. That is simply where they are. And I think that is quite appalling because they should be on Israel's side to crush Hezbollah, to crush Hamas, to crush the Houthis, and do that with our assistance as much as possible, to set Iran back for years to come and remove them as the dominant aggressive force in the region. Israel will likely seize an opportunity here in the future, not too far away, to deal with Iran's nuclear enterprise. They've had some success with it through covert espionage operations, setting it back a year or so. They'll likely do that again and maybe also kinetic airstrikes. Don't expect the United States to be involved in anything like that in the near future. I go back to my premise. They just want the war to stop. They'll take the status quo is unfortunate as that is and how adverse that would be for the Israelis. General, two things. Jair Rukushner was active on social media over the weekend. He was heavily involved in the Abraham Accords. He agrees with you. Iran is now fully exposed. The reason why the nuclear facilities have not been destroyed, despite weak air defense systems, is because Hezbollah has been a loaded gun pointer to Israel. The right move now for America will be to tell Israel to finish the job. It is long overdue. A year ago yesterday, Jake Sullivan said this about the Middle East. The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades. The amount of time that I have to spend on crisis and conflict in the Middle East today, compared to any of my predecessors going back to 9-11, is significantly reduced. Is that time, General, October 7th, and on and on and on? Just need a quick response on that. Well, when he said that, the Iranian back proxies in Iraq and in Syria had already attacked the United States forces 125 times prior to October 7th. It's 175 times since that time. That's how appalling and misrepresentation of the facts are and have been to the American people. They have had this dead wrong. This hands-off approach for Iran is getting us nowhere. But they're not going to do much of anything. They could easily take the Houthis off the board here by taking out Iran's spy ship that's helping them target, taking down their navy that's helping them transport the missiles and the rockets, but we're doing nothing. The Houthis have locked down the Suez Canal back by Iran for months. They are fired at U.S. Navy warships using anti-ship ballistic missiles bill. And what are we doing? Nothing. It's appalling. Maybe that would not step in up here. General, thank you so much. We're going to lean on you throughout the week, okay? Thank you. Jack Keen, thanks for coming on. I'm Steve Doosie. I'm Brian Killme.
